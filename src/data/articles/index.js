                sContent: "<p>Osteonecrosis of hip or Avascular necrosis (AVN) of hip, is the vascular disruption of the hip joint lead to the death of the femoral head. AVN is more common in males than in females. Most Commonly clinically presents as the insidious onset of pain around the hip and restricted range of motion of hip Join that lead to patients have a problem in wait bearing and during walking. Patients cannot walk properly.</p><p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. D-dimer elevation is often observed in patients with acute COVID-19 due acute lung injury itself or due thromboembolic complications that occur frequently in COVID-19. Thromboembolism can damaged nearby blood vessels and reduce blood flow to bones lead to AVN can developed. Those who are suffering from Mild to Moderate COVID-19 they take more amount of corticosteroids during the acute phase of infection. Use of high-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone can increase lipid levels in the blood, reducing blood flow. Due to Increase Lipid Levels and more Thromboembolism the cases of AVN Hip is increasing day by day.</p><p>Physiotherapy Can be used for relief of symptoms of Pain and Restricted ROM of hip joint. It can be help to prevent of disease progression and Improvement of functional activity and ADL. Physical therapy treatment focuses on exercises to maintain joint mobility and strengthen the muscles around the affected hip joint. Exercises will focus on the muscles of the hip and thigh but will also include exercises for the core area as they play a large supporting role. To improve functionality, it is important to implement endurance training and coordination training in a more advanced stage of the therapy.</p>"

This profoundly affects daily activities and frequently impairs functional tasks. Low back pain (LBP) affects nearly 60-80% of people throughout their lifetime.One of the suspected etiologies of LBP is lack of hamstring flexibility. Sitting at a desk all day can cause tightness and a shortening of hamstring muscles, and therefore leads to back pain.</p><p>The hamstring group refers to the posterior thigh muscles and act as strong flexors of the knee and weak extensors of the hip.</p><p>Hamstring group of muscles includes <strong>semitendinosus</strong>, <strong>semimembranosus</strong>, and <strong>long and short heads</strong> of the <strong>biceps femoris</strong>. All together flex the knee but the short head of biceps femoris alone extends the hip.Blood supply from the perforating branches of the deep femoral artery ,also known as the profunda femoris artery.</p><p>We might be wondering how hamstring tightness could result in back pain. The body is interconnected, and prolonged sitting without stretching can cause the hamstrings to constrict and shorten. These muscles originate from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis . The pelvis tilts posteriorly as a result of tight hamstrings As the pelvis and the lumbar vertebrae work together, when the pelvis tilts posteriorly, the lumbar vertebrae are forced to flex forward. The pelvis, lumbar spine, and surrounding muscles are put under more tension and strain as a result of this. Blood supply to the hamstrings will be reduced if they are tight. Therefore, muscles are working with less capacity, which results in low back pain.</p><p>The predominance of tightness is greater in female 96% than in male 4%. Its incidence is high in university students from 18-25 years.</p><p><strong>Stretch to reduce the pain .The stretches can gradually lengthen and reduce tension in the hamstring muscle, and in turn reduce stress felt in the lower back.</strong></p>"

According to research, elderly men&#39;s and women&#39;s immunological responses to influenza vaccine vary significantly.</p><p>Hormonal differences between men and women have a significant role in these discrepancies. Estrogen, which is found in greater amounts in women, has been demonstrated to improve immunological response to vaccinations, particularly flu injections. According to studies, women may have a stronger immunological response to vaccination than males because of hormonal influences.</p><p>Furthermore, age-related immune system changes, known as immunosenescence, influence how older people respond to immunizations. In general, older persons have a weakened immune system, which leads to a worse response to vaccination. However, research suggests that women may maintain greater immune function as they age than males, perhaps leading to a more effective response to flu vaccines.</p><p>In addition, variations in the way older men and women react to flu vaccines might be attributed to hereditary factors. It is known that individual reactions to vaccination are influenced by differences in genes linked to immune function and vaccine response. Variations in vaccination effectiveness between older men and women have been identified; these discrepancies may be partially explained by genetic differences.</p><p>In summary, whereas vaccinations against influenza protect against the disease for older men and women alike, there are notable variations in the immune responses of these populations. Comprehending these distinctions is crucial for refining vaccination plans for senior citizens and creating specialized methods to increase vaccination efficacy in this demographic.</p>'

This age-related muscle wasting can have significant impacts on an individual's quality of life, leading to decreased mobility, increased risk of falls, and overall reduced ability to perform daily tasks.</p><p>While some muscle loss is a natural part of the aging process, sarcopenia goes beyond the typical decline in muscle mass that occurs with age. It is often associated with factors such as decreased physical activity, poor diet, hormonal changes, and chronic illnesses. Additionally, sarcopenia can be exacerbated by conditions like inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. The consequences of sarcopenia can be far-reaching. Loss of muscle mass can lead to a decrease in metabolism, making it more difficult to maintain a healthy weight. It can also impact balance and coordination, increasing the risk of falls and fractures. Furthermore, reduced muscle strength can affect overall mobility and independence, potentially limiting an individual's ability to live an active and fulfilling life.</p><p>Preventing and managing sarcopenia requires a multifaceted approach. Regular physical activity, particularly resistance training, is essential for preserving muscle mass and function. Adequate protein intake is also crucial for supporting muscle maintenance and repair. Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, managing chronic conditions, and ensuring adequate vitamin D and calcium levels can help mitigate the effects of sarcopenia. Early detection and intervention are crucial for addressing sarcopenia, enabling healthcare providers to assess muscle mass and strength, and implementing targeted interventions like exercise programs.</p><p>Sarcopenia, a significant health concern, can significantly impact physical function and well-being, particularly in older adults.

                sContent: "<p>An exercise routine may feel time consuming — but no matter what type of workout you choose, or how busy your schedule is, it’s critical that you don’t skip warming up before your workout, or cooling down afterwards. You’d be surprised how many people decide they don’t need to warm up before working their core, or that it’s fine to skip their cool-down after jogging on the treadmill.</p><p>In most cases, it’s not because people hate doing the warm up or cool-down, but because they want to save time. Unfortunately, it’s not just the main part of your workout that matters — and the people who skip the processes before and after a workout may be doing more harm to their bodies than they realize.</p><div class='text-center mb-3'><img src='/assets/img/vol-2-issue-2-a2.png' /></div><h3>Why Warming Up and Cooling Down Is So Important</h3><p>A warm-up and a cool-down both involve doing exercises at a lower intensity and slower pace, which improves your athletic performance, prevents injuries, and helps with recovery from exercise.</p><p>Warm up activities include light jogging, or cycling slowly on a bike. Warming up before exercise prepares your cardiovascular system for physical activity, by increasing the blood flow to your muscles, and raising the temperature of your body. It also helps to lower the risk of getting injured — when your muscles are adequately warmed up, the movements, stretches, and strain you put on them during your workout is less severe. This also minimizes muscle soreness.</p><p>Warm up activities include light jogging, or cycling slowly on a bike.

It also helps to lower the risk of getting injured — when your muscles are adequately warmed up, the movements, stretches, and strain you put on them during your workout is less severe. This also minimizes muscle soreness.</p><p>Cooling down after your workout aims to gradually bring your heart rate and blood pressure to its normal level — the level it was at prior to exercising. During your workout, your heart rate has been pumping much higher than it does normally, and it’s important to ease it back down instead of abruptly stopping all motion. Cooling down also helps to regulate your blood flow, which is especially important for people who undertake endurance sports such as long distance running. To safely cool down, gradually reduce the pace of your exercise during the last 10 minutes of your session — for example, if you’re jogging, reduce your pace to a brisk walk for the last 10 minutes.</p><h3>Benefits of Warming Up</h3><div><ul><li><p><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Warming up improves your athletic performance in the following ways:</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved Blood Flow:</strong> Warming up for 10 minutes with an easygoing activity improves blood flowing to your skeletal muscles, and opens up blood capillaries. Your blood carries the oxygen needed for your muscles to function, so increasing your blood flow is one of the best things you can do to set your muscles up for a workout.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved Oxygen Efficiency:</strong> When you do a warm-up exercise, oxygen is released from your blood more readily, and at higher temperatures. Your muscles demand higher amounts of oxygen while exercising, so it’s important to make this oxygen more available through a warm-up activity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Faster Muscle Contraction/Relaxation:</strong> Warming up with physical activity raises your body temperature, which in turn, improves your nerve transmission and muscle metabolism. The end result? Your muscles will perform faster and more efficiently.</p></li><li><p><strong>Injury Prevention:</strong> Warming up prevents injuries by loosening your joints, and improving blood flow to your muscles — making your muscles less likely to rip, tear, or twist in a harmful way during your workout. Stretching also helps prepare your muscles for the physical activities you’re about to perform.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mental Preparation:</strong> A side benefit of warming up is that your brain will become focused on your body and your physical activity as you go through the process. This focus will carry over into your training session to help you to improve your technique, coordination, and skill.</p></li></ul></div><h3>Benefits of Cooling Down</h3><div><ul><li><p><strong>Recovery:</strong> After intense exercise, lactic acid builds up within your system, and it takes time for your body to clear it out. Cooling down exercises (such as stretches) can aid this process of releasing and removing lactic acid, helping to speed up your body’s recovery post-workout.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reducing DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness):</strong> While muscle soreness is to be expected after exercise, a significant amount of DOMS is very uncomfortable, and can prevent you from exercising in the future. A study performed by California State University found that moderate intensity cycling after strength exercise helped to reduce DOMS. Cooling down after exercise helps to alleviate excessive muscle soreness, keeping you more comfortable and allowing your body to bounce back before your next workout.</p></li></ul></div><h3>What Happens If You Don’t Properly Warm Up and Cool Down?</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Increased Risk Of Injury:</strong> Over 30% of injuries seen by sports medicine clinics are skeletal muscle injuries — which can be easily prevented by warming up and stretching.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blood Pooling:</strong> If you stop exercising abruptly without cooling down, your muscles will suddenly stop contracting vigorously. This can cause blood to pool in the lower extremities of your body, leaving your blood without as much pressure to be pumped back to the heart and brain. As a result, you may dizzy and lightheaded, and you may even faint.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased Stress On Cardiovascular System:</strong> Warming up helps you to gradually increase your heart rate and breathing to a level that will be able to meet the demands of your workout. If you start exercising at a strenuous level without warming up first, you will place unnecessary stress on your heart and lungs.</p><p>The next time you feel like you can’t spare the extra 10 minutes to cool down after running, think carefully about the effect it will have on your body. Those 10 minutes certainly seem worth it when you consider that you’re helping prevent injuries to your body, improve your performance, and aid your post-workout recovery.</p></li></ul>"

                sContent: "<h3 class='mb-0'>INTRODUCTION:</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><h4>LOWER CROSSED SYNDROME</h4><p>Lower crossed syndrome (LCS) is a musculoskeletal imbalance characterized by specific patterns of muscle weakness and tightness that crosses between the dorsal and ventral sides of the body. It is also known as a pelvic crossed syndrome. In lower crossed syndrome, the thoraco-lumber extensors are tight in dorsal side and there are also tightness in illiopsoas on the other side. While there are weakness in abdominals muscles and gluteus maximus muscles.</p><p>The result of chain reaction that the pelvis tips forward on the frontal plane, flexing the hip joints and producing lumber lordosis and stress at L5-S1 with pain and irritation. A further stress commonly appears in the sagittal plane in which quadratus lumborum tightness and gluteus maximus weaken.</p><p>When this ‘lateral corset’ becomes unstable, the pelvis is held in increased elevation, accentuated when walking, resulting in L5-S1 stress in the sagittal plane. One result is low-back pain. The combined stresses described produce instability at the lumbodorsal junction, an unstable transition point at best.</p><p>Failure of coactivation due to persistent tonic activity results in faulty neurodevelopment of the motor system. This eventually promoting lower crossed syndromes.</p><h4>FLATFOOT</h4><p>Flatfoot deformity defined by the loss of medial longitudinal arch of the foot where it contacts or nearly contacts the ground. There are two types of flatfoot deformity. The first type is rigid or congenital flatfoot and second type is acquired or flexible flatfoot.</p><p>Flexible flatfoot may result from tibial or femoral torsion, coxa vara, a defect in the subtalar joint, or injury to the posterior tibial tendon.</p><p>The need of the study is to evaluate the incidence low back pain in Physiotherapy students. To evaluate incidence of lower cross syndrome and flat foot in low back pain subjects</p><h4>Design:</h4><p>A total 234 students both girls and boys between age group 18 to 24 years were screened by self administered questionnaire form, from which 82 students having low back pain are taken into consideration. Each student were underwent for assessment of tightness of illopsoas with use of thomas test, tightness of errector spine ( LUMBER FLEXION ROM) with use of modified modified schober’s test , strenght of abdominals and gluteus maximus with use of manual muscle testing, flatffot with using of nevicular drop test.</p><h4 class='m-0'>METHODS:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><h5>MEASUREMENT OF EERECTOR SPINE THIGHTNESS:</h5><p>Modified Modified schober’s test: Ask the subject to standing postion. Place a first mark at a middline point on the sacrum that is level with the posterior superior illiac spine( this mark will be over the spinous process of S2). Make a second mark 15 cm above the middline sacral mark. Align the tape measure between the superior and inferior marks. Ask the subject to bend forward as far as possible while keeping the knees straight. Maintain the tape measure against the individual’s back during the motion, but allow the tape measure to unwind to accommodate the motion. At the end of flexion ROM, note the distance between the two marks.(1)</p><h5>MEASUREMENT OF ABDOMINAL MUSCLE STRENGTH:</h5><p>The subject were placed in supine lying position with legs straight and fingertips lightly touching the back of the head ( Grade 5 ) , arm crossed over the chest ( Grade 4 ), arms outstretched in full extension above the plane of the body (Grade 3). For Grade 2 ,1 and 0 subject were placed in supine lying position with arm at sides. Knees flexed. Therapist stand at side of the table at level of patient’s chest to ascertain whether scapular clear table during test. Then ask the subject to lift the shoulders, and back off table, keeping the chin pointed to cilling. Patient flexes trunk through range of motion, lifting the trunk until scapulae clear the table. IF the patient has weak hip flexors, therapist should stabilize the pelvis by leaning across the patient on the forearms.(2)</p><h5>MEASUREMENT OF GLUTEUS MAXIMUS STRENGTH:</h5><p>The subject is ask to lie in prone with knee flexed 90 degrees, hip abducted and externally rotated. Therapist stand at leval of the pelvis on the side to be tested. Ask the subject to lift the thigh off the plinth as high as possible, while bending the knee. Place the hand for resistance over the posterior thigh just above the knee. The opposite hand may stabilize or maintain the alignment of the pelvis. Resistance is given in a straight downward direction. According to MRC grading the strength of gluteus maximus was graded.(2)</p><h5>MEASUREMENT OF ILLIOPSOAS MUSCLE TIGHTNESS:</h5><p>Ask the subject to lies supine. The examiner flexes one of the subject’s hips, bringing the knee to chest to flatten out the lumber spine and to stabilize the pelvis. The subject holds the flexed hips against the chest. If the is a no tightness, the hip being tested ( The straight leg) remains on the examining table. If the tightness is present, the subject’s straight leg raises off the table and muscle stretch end feel will be felt. If the lower limb is pushed down onto the table, the subject may exhibit an increased lordosis; again, the result indicate the positive test.(3)</p><h5>MEASUREMENT OF FLATFOOT:</h5><p>Ask the subject to relax sitting position. The examiner first measure the height of the navicular from the floor in the neutral talus position using the most prominant part of the navicular tuberosity and then measure the height of the navicular in normal relaxed standing. The difference is called navicular drop.

                sContent: "<h3>ABSTRACT:</h3><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the underlying reason for occurrence of stroke in young craftsman and make him achieve his goal of performing activities of daily living independently post stroke. He underwent physiotherapy treatment for seven days while admitted in the ward where the exercises were given on the basis of impairments. The therapy was targeted to achieve his goal to return to his working routine and earn for the living for him as well as his family.</p><h4>Keywords</h4><p>Young stroke, Hemorrhage</p><hr/><h3 class='mt-4'>INTRODUCTION:</h3><p>The occurrence of stroke in young adults comprises of around 10-15% of total stroke in a year worldwide.1 Most of young strokes encountered are ischemic ones whereas very few of them are found to be hemorrhagic. Approximately 30-35% of young stroke cases are accounted to be hemorrhagic (Intracerebral and subarachnoid).2</p><p>Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability, morbidity and mortality in the world. People suffering from stroke have greater impact on family and social life. They are often employed, peaking at their careers, caring for the dependents in the family which is affected due to impairments persisting post stroke. Rehabilitation and recovery process for young stroke survivors differs from those in older adults. It involves restoring the person to his or her functional status before stoke as well as able to return to occupation.</p><p>Most of young stroke cases do not have known and usual etiologies. There many underlying possibilities not understood at time of onset such as developmental cardiac abnormalities, hematological disorders, chronic systemic inflammation and many others.3Many risk factors are also responsible for stroke in young adults such as drug abuse, contraceptive use, and hypertension.</p><p>Young stroke is a major cause of concern in developing countries such as India as they belong to earning strata of the society. This case study aimed at knowing the underlying pathology in a young stroke patient and rehabilitates him to a functional level so that he can join his job.</p><h3>CASE DESCRIPTION:</h3><p>A 26 year old male, craftsman by occupation, presented with history of loss of consciousness followed by regaining it after 2 mins while playing outdoors and was in usual state after that. Around 5 hours after this episode he had a syncope accompanied by involuntary movements and loss of consciousness. He was reported to have seizure episode and was admitted in ICU in local hospital. He underwent emergency intubation was on ventilator for a day and then weaned off.</p><p>He was suggested to shift in tertiary hospital care, where on the way he had a fall in ambulance but sustained no external injuries. After around 3 days, he had sudden onset of severe headache posteriorly and aching in nature, and sudden weakness of right hand and right leg characterized by inability to lift right arm and move right leg. He was immediately shifted to ICU and immediate medical care was taken. MRI investigations were done which revealed minimal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) in bilateral parietal regions. He recovered from his weakness after around 7-8 hours after onset of weakness. He was then shifted to ward and referred for physiotherapy treatment.</p><p>The patient did not have any history of hypertension. He reported to have occlusion of varicose veins by thrombus about a year age which was resolved with allopathy medications for month followed by homeopathy medication for around 7 months. He did not report of having any addictions.</p><p>On examination by physiotherapy department, he had intact higher motor functions and speech with retention of memory about the subsequent events that occurred which led to the weakness. On observation he had stoop posture in sitting with protracted shoulders. The cranial nerves and sensation were intact, plantar reflex was up going on right side and deep tendon reflexes were normal (++) bilaterally. Tone was normal but there was some amount of weakness persisting in right lower extremity. Muscles such as hip flexors, abductors, extensors; knee flexors, extensors and dorsiflexors were graded 4 on doing MMT (Manual Muscle Testing) on right side. Balance was affected with fair dynamic balance in standing and good static balance. He could perform transitions such as supine to sit, sit to stand, and walk independently or requiring supervision at times. His baseline measurement of STREAM (Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement), TIS (Trunk Impairment Scale), Mini-BESTest scales were taken whose values were 56/70, 20/23, 10/28 respectively. He had difficulty in performing activities such as dressing, bathing and toileting activities and required minimal help of bystanders to perform these activities.</p><h3>INTERVENTION:</h3><p>The therapy aimed at strengthening of weak muscles and balance training to help him to achieve independence in performing activities of daily living.</p><p>Muscles such as shoulder flexors, abductors, elbow flexors, hip flexors and abductors, knee flexors and extensors, dorsiflexors were strengthened by attaching 1 kg weight cuff and moving the limbs in required direction. Weight bearing activities such as partial squats, single limb squats (weight bearing on right side) were done with 10 repetitions in 2 sets.</p><p>Balance training involved giving reach outs within base of support and out of base of support in sitting as well as standing. He was made to stand with narrow base of support for 30 seconds initially with eyes closed gradually after 6 days of regular training he could stand for 60 seconds in narrow base of support. Similarly single limb stance initially he could stand only for 15seconds with eyes closed on right leg, progression was made each day, and with training he could maintain balance for 45 seconds after 6 days of training.</p><p>Ambulation- He was made to walk on a straight line on 2nd day of reference, gradually the complexities were increased such as head turns during walking, altering speed while walking, taking turns, answering questions simultaneously (training for dual tasks). These activities were targeted so that while performing regular activities patient did not lose balance.</p><p>On 5th day of training he was trained with stair climbing initially with one step upwards with one leg followed by other leg on the same step with railings support. Progressively he was made to climb stairs with alternate stepping without railings support.</p><p>After 7 days of intervention, scales were again taken to know the amount of improvement with respect to recovery. The STREAM score was 70/70, TIS was 23/23, Mini-BESTest was 21/28 on the day of discharge from hospital.</p><p>He was given advised to avoid addictions, in case of similar episode to have emergency consultation to neurologist and regular compliance with neurologist was suggested as he was at high risk of developing similar episode.</p><h3>RESULTS:</h3><p>After 7 days of physiotherapy treatment the patient could balance while walking, reduced incidences imbalance when distracted while walking. He could perform activities such as dressing, bathing, and toileting independently without supervision of bystanders. He was ready to resume his job within few days and support the family.</p><h3>DISCUSSIONS:</h3><p>Functional prognosis represents one of the most important and meaningful aspects of outcome of disease. The patient almost recovered from the impairments suffered post stroke.</p><p>The patient did not have any history of long standing headache (migraine) indicating internal bleed. There is no history fall or trauma on head causing internal bleed. Symptoms such as severe headache and loss of consciousness in indicative of hemorrhage but pathology causing hemorrhage could not be understood.</p><p>SAH has high chances of neuroinflammation causing early brain injury and delayed brain deterioration including cellular and molecular events.4So it was necessary to make the patient aware of possible consequences such as reoccurrence of stroke.</p><h3>CONCLUSION:</h3><p>The case study reveals that conventional physiotherapy techniques and methods helped the patient achieve his goal of performing activities of daily living independently. The therapist ensured that the patient was counselled about his condition and had chances of further complication and to take appropriate preventive measures.</p><h3 class='mt-4'>REFRENCES:</h3><div><ol><li><p>Smajlović D.

                sContent: "<p>In the dynamic field of women's health, physiotherapy stands as a beacon of holistic care, transcending the traditional confines of physical treatment. This discipline, enriched by insights from 'Obstetrics by Ten Teachers', 'Gynaecology by Ten Teachers', and 'National Guidelines for Quality Obstetrics and Perinatal Care', offers a well-rounded approach to health, particularly for pregnant women and those with gestational diabetes. This article delves into the intricacies of diet and nutrition, exercise, yoga, ergonomics, healthy habits, and personal hygiene, highlighting their collective impact on women's health.</p><h3>Diet and Nutrition : The Foundation of Women's Health</h3><p>Proper nutrition is a cornerstone of health, especially during the crucial phases of pregnancy and lactation. Women's bodies require a symphony of nutrients to support their own health and that of their developing babies. Key nutrients include calcium, crucial for bone health and a vital component in preventing osteoporosis; iron, essential for combating anemia, especially significant during menstruation and pregnancy; folate, a B-vitamin critical for preventing birth defects and aiding in fetal brain development; and vitamin D, vital for overall health and immune function.</p><p>A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats, supports not just physical health, but also mental well-being. For those with specific conditions like gestational diabetes, diet plays a therapeutic role. A low-glycemic diet rich in fiber, lean protein, and healthy fats helps regulate blood sugar levels, ensuring both maternal and fetal health.</p><h3>Exercise and Yoga: Enhancing Physical and Mental Well-being</h3><p>Physical activity is a pillar of health, offering benefits that extend beyond weight management. Cardiovascular exercises, such as walking, swimming, or cycling, improve heart health and enhance circulatory efficiency. Strength training, often overlooked, is crucial for maintaining muscle mass and bone density, particularly important in preventing osteoporosis. Yoga, with its emphasis on flexibility, balance, and mental focus, offers a unique set of benefits. During pregnancy, yoga can alleviate common discomforts like back pain, enhance circulation, and prepare the body for childbirth through focused breathing and relaxation techniques. Moreover, the mental benefits of yoga, including stress reduction and mindfulness, contribute significantly to overall well-being.</p><h3>Ergonomic and Hygiene Practices for Optimal Health:</h3><p>Ergonomics, particularly in the context of women's health, involves designing work and home environments that support physical well-being. Proper ergonomic practices reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, a common ailment among women due to their diverse roles and responsibilities. During pregnancy, ergonomic adaptations are essential to accommodate the changing body and prevent strain and injury.</p><p>In addition to ergonomics, personal hygiene plays a crucial role in women's health. Regular bathing, proper genital care, and appropriate menstrual hygiene practices are essential for preventing infections and maintaining overall well-being. This is particularly important during menstruation and pregnancy, when hormonal changes can affect the body's susceptibility to infections.</p><h3>Healthy Habits for a Balanced Life:</h3><p>Healthy habits form the bedrock of a balanced lifestyle. Quality sleep is essential for physical repair and mental clarity. Relaxation techniques and effective stress management are as important as physical health practices. Mental well-being, fostered through mindfulness and meditation, has a profound impact on overall health.</p><p>Hydration is another key aspect of healthy living. Drinking adequate water daily is crucial for bodily functions and can prevent common issues like urinary tract infections, which are more prevalent in women. Avoiding harmful habits such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption is vital for long-term health and well-being.</p><p>In conclusion, the integration of physiotherapy with diet, exercise, ergonomics, healthy habits, and personal hygiene offers a comprehensive framework for enhancing women's health. This is especially important during transformative phases such as pregnancy and postpartum. The application of evidence-based practices, informed by authoritative sources, enables physiotherapists to make significant contributions to women's health, guiding them toward healthier, more balanced lives.</p><p>By understanding and addressing the unique needs of women at different life stages, physiotherapy can play a pivotal role in not just treating but also preventing a range of health issues. This proactive, holistic approach is the key to empowering women to take charge of their health and well-being.</p>"

Two terms coined in the NICU that should be learned are ‘Early intervention’ & ‘Developmental supportive care’.</p><h4>EARLY INTERVENTION:</h4><hr class='mt-0'/><p>It is a prevention-focused program that aims to support the well- being of preterm infants and their families. It involves identifying and providing early support to children who are at risk of poor outcomes and can help prevent problems from occurring or address them before they worsen. Early intervention programs are often implemented soon after birth, when the infant's brain is still developing and interventions are most likely to have the greatest impact.</p><h4 class='mt-4'>DEVELOPMENTAL SUPPORTIVE CARE:</h4><hr class='mt-0'/><p>It is a practice model that aims to reduce stress and pain for babies, parents, and healthcare professionals in a neonatal unit. It also aims to provide babies with developmentally appropriate sensory experiences and maximize their neurological development. This approach can help reduce long-term cognitive and behaviouralproblems. <br/><br/>As a Physiotherapist in NICU, we can do....</p><p><strong>Nesting: </strong>In utero, the fetus is confined to an enclosed space with well-defined boundaries to support the development of physiological flexion. The boundaries allow a fetus to extend his arms and legs to meet resistance and subsequently recoil his extremities into a gently flexed position. This physiological flexion is necessary for the development of normal posture movement control. In the Nesting technique, the babies are protected inside a nest made out of rolls of cloth. It improves the comfort of neonates. The rolls can help them to feel boundaries and they can push up against the sides of the rolls comforting them (Fig-1). Nesting can be done while the infant is in the NICU and placed on a monitor that helps to ensure that the baby is physiologically stable. Because of the fragility of preterm infants, most NICUs have adopted a minimal handling and stimulation approach for very immature infants.</p><p><strong>Swaddling: </strong>Swaddling is the art of snugly wrapping a baby in a blanket for warmth and security. It can keep the baby from being disturbed by her startle reflex, and it can help her stay warm and toasty for the first few days of life until her internal thermostat kicks in. It may even help to calm the baby.</p><p><strong>Positioning: </strong>Preterm infants characteristically demonstrate low postural tone, with the amount of hypotonia varying with gestational age. Developmentally supportive positioning for infants in NICU may help to reinforce normal skeletal alignment and provide opportunities for normal movement patterns. In addition, positioning can provide skin care and support respiratory function. The combination of these three benefits can allow the infant to improve and longer sleep.</p><p>Research indicates that infants with long stays in NICU, who are not appropriately positioned, are at risk for positional plagiocephaly, and torticollis and may demonstrate a decrease in the quality and spontaneity of movement. The goal of neonatal positioning is to Optimize alignment toward a neutral neck-trunk position semiflexed, midline extremity posture, and neutral foot position. Hyperextension of the neck, Frequent head turning to the side, Lower extremity frogging, and use of Bigger diapers should be avoided.</p><div class='text-center mb-3 d-flex justify-content-center volOneIssueThreeImg'><img src='/assets/img/image-1(A).jpg' /><img src='/assets/img/image-1(B).jpg' /></div><p>Kangaroo Mother Care: It is a Special way of caring for preterm-low birth weight babies which is practiced in many cultures. It fosters their health and well-being by promoting physiologic stability, breastfeeding, infection prevention, and increased maternal confidence & bonding. Kangaroo care is also known as skin-to-skin contact and the baby is breastfed exclusively to the utmost extent. Direct contact is established by removing all the baby's clothes, except for their diaper, and lying them in a prone position on the mother's chest (the Baby’s abdomen should be at the level of the mother’s epigastria) (Fig-2). It has been found that kangaroo care can be neuroprotective as it supports brain plasticity. KMC can be started as soon as the baby is stable in the hospital and continued at home. Short KMC sessions can be initiated during recovery with ongoing medical treatment (IV fluids, oxygen therapy). During KMC, Mother’s breathing stimulates the baby’s breathing, thus reducing the occurrence of apnea. It also helps decrease maternal stress and depression.</p><div class='text-center mb-3 volOneIssueThreeImg'><img src='/assets/img/image-2.png' /></div><p><strong>Therapeutic Massage:</strong> Infant massage (i.e. gentle and slow hand contact) is an early intervention approach to help with a newborn's tactile sense. There is some evidence to suggest that massage can help with growth and weight gain for low birth weight and premature babies, reduce the length of stay in the hospital, reduce neonatal stress, and promote sleep.</p><p>Massage therapy with moderate pressure may be useful. Research by Lu et al. has found that moderate- pressure massage therapy can cause greater daily weight gain in preterm infants than light- pressure massage therapy(Fig-3).</p><div class='text-center mb-3 volOneIssueThreeImg'><img src='/assets/img/image-3.png' /></div><p><strong>Therapeutic Handling:</strong> The primary aims of handling include assisting the newborn to achieve maximal interaction with parents & caregivers, and facilitating postural & movement patterns appropriate to the infant’s adjusted gestational age. It includes care of a neonate around sleep/wake cycles time, no routine procedure, Providing 2-3 hrs of uninterrupted sleep, following “Minimal Handling” or “Quiet hour” Protocol, reducing noise, Reduce lights, and Clustering the caregiving procedure. Don’t disturb the baby all the time.</p><p><strong>Physical Activity:</strong> It has been proposed that a lack of physical stimulation might contribute to metabolic bone disease in preterm infants, leading to decreased bone mineralization and growth. Therefore, physical activity has been explored as an intervention to help promote bone mineralization and growth. Physical activity for neonates includes facilitating extension and flexion of the extremities, performing a range of motion exercises, and holding patients into flexion to help facilitate pushing against resistance. These exercises are usually completed for several minutes, several times a week for at least two weeks. Doğan et al. note that passive range of motion exercises may be beneficial for bone development, especially when applied to an infant's proximal joints.</p><p><strong>Multimodal stimulation:</strong> The use of tactile, vestibular, proprioceptive, visual & auditory stimuli to facilitate infant development has been reported. For auditory stimuli, Soft & soothing music is used. For the tactile stimulus Gentle touch, massage & swaddling, For Visual stimulus pictures/human faces, and bright toys are used. For the Vestibular stimulus gentle rocking movements, and swinging are beneficial.</p><p><strong>Non-Nutritive Sucking:</strong> High-priority functional activities in the NICU are sucking and swallowing. These actions should be supported by the physiotherapist and other caregivers. Non-nutritive sucking provides tactile stimulation to the intraoral structures and facial muscles through a pacifier or a glove-wearing finger (Fig-4). Research shows that non-nutritive sucking can help reduce the length of hospital stay and improve feeding behaviours. It can be done using pacifiers.</p><div class='text-center mb-3 volOneIssueThreeImg'><img src='/assets/img/image-4.jpg' /></div><p><strong>Family Education:</strong> Family education is a substantial component of interventional care in the NICU. Understanding how to care for the preterm infant is important for posture and movement development, parent-infant attachment, and maintaining the baby's physiological stability. Coaching the family on how to best support the baby's motor development should include topics such as feeding, dressing, sleep positioning, playing and communicating, therapeutic holding, and carrying the newborn after discharge.</p><h4 class='mt-4'>OUR LIFE IN NICU: STORY OF A NICU GRADUATE</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Hello, I am a ‘NICU graduate child’ means after birth I lived in the NICU for some days. My mother said that I was born 8 weeks earlier than the expected date of delivery, so everyone used to call me ‘preemie’. In NICU I made many friends. I heard that some of my friends were like me born premature and others had weak lungs (Respiratory distress syndrome), heart infections (Necrotizing endocarditis), brain tissue infections (Meningitis/Encephalitis), bleeding in the brain (Intraventricular hemorrhage), etc. But all were very strong fighters just like me. The room of the NICU was so strenuous and loaded heavily with noxious stimuli that we couldn’t handle it. The loud noise of machines, the flashing lights, frequent running of doctors and nurses used to frighten me. I was put on oxygen therapy by ‘O2 hood’, and the Nasogastric tube was inserted inside my nose for feeding, and for regulation of my body temperature I used to sleep under a Radiant heat warmer. Besides all these displeasures, I was under constant observation and great care by my neonatologist, physiotherapist, nursing staff, and many more people who always work with enthusiasm. For my weaker lungs, Dr. Neonatologist gave me SURFACTANT THERAPY that made my lungs stronger and helped me breathe efficiently. My Physiotherapist used to SWADDLE me to calm me down and help me regulate my body, giving me different POSITIONINGand NESTING, she used to do MASSAGE THERAPY to strengthen my muscles and CHEST PHYSIOTHERAPY to clear secretions from my lungs. She also taught me NON-NUTRITIVE SUCKING so that later on I can do breastfeeding nicely. My therapist also taught my mother to give KANGAROO MOTHER CARE (skin-to-skin contact) which had increased ‘Mother- Infant bonding’ between us. Gradually I started improving and gaining weight so they sent me home with my family!!</p><p>After living so long in my mother’s womb which is the calmest and safest place, suddenly coming to NICU was quite scary for me so used to cry, cry, and cry....But after realizing that how much care and help they are giving me I wanted to THANK them but I have no words to describe so again I started crying, crying, and crying......!!!</p>"

                sContent: "<p>Impact of Physiotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer Head and neck cancer is broadly recognized as the seventh most frequently occurring type of cancer and consists of a various array of tumors affecting the upper aerodigestive tract. Despite the presence of various histologies, squamous cell carcinoma remains the most prevalent. Predominant risk factors include tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and oncogenic viruses, including human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus. Head and neck cancer, comprising a range of malignancies affecting the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and surrounding structures, presents complex challenges in both treatment and rehabilitation.[1]</p><p>Physiotherapy plays a crucial role in the management of Oral, Head, and Neck cancer especially during and after Treatment. Here’s how physiotherapy can help [2]</p><div><ol><li><p>Restoration of Function and Mobility: Physiotherapy assists in restoring function and mobility to areas affected by surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Therapists develop personalized exercise programs to improve strength, flexibility, and range of motion in the jaw, head, and neck.</p></li><li><p>Swallowing and Speech Therapy: Speech-language pathologists, often working closely with physiotherapists, help patients regain the ability to swallow and speak properly after treatment. This may involve exercises to strengthen swallowing muscles and techniques to improve speech clarity.</p></li><li><p>Pain Management: Physiotherapists use various techniques such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and modalities like heat and cold therapy to manage pain and discomfort associated with cancer treatment.</p></li><li><p>Education and Support: Physiotherapists educate patients about self-care techniques, posture correction, and energy conservation strategies to optimize recovery and enhance the quality of life during and after cancer treatment. Overall, physiotherapy plays a vital role in addressing physical impairments, improving function, and promoting overall well-being in individuals undergoing treatment for oral, head, and neck cancer.</p></li></ol></div><p>TheraBite Jaw Motion Rehabilitation System: Enhancing Jaw Mobility in Head and Neck Cancer Rehabilitation TheraBite is a jaw motion rehabilitation system designed to improve jaw function, range of motion, and reduce trismus (limited mouth opening) often experienced by head and neck cancer patients. The device consists of a hand-held controller and custom-fit mouthpieces, allowing patients to perform exercises that gently stretch and mobilize the jaw muscles and temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Here's how TheraBite is typically utilized in the rehabilitation of head and neck cancer patients:</p><div><ol><li><p>Trismus Management: After surgical procedures or radiation therapy, patients may experience trismus due to scarring, fibrosis, or muscle stiffness. TheraBite helps gradually stretch the muscles and tissues, promoting increased mouth opening over time.</p></li><li><p>Improving Jaw Mobility: TheraBite exercises involve controlled, repetitive movements of the jaw, encouraging improved mobility and flexibility. Patients work with their physiotherapists or speech therapists to establish a customized exercise regimen based on their specific needs and limitations.</p></li><li><p>Pain Management: Jaw exercises with TheraBite can also help alleviate discomfort or pain associated with muscle tightness and restricted movement. The device allows patients to perform exercises at their own pace, adjusting the intensity as tolerated.</p></li><li><p>Functional Restoration: By promoting increased jaw mobility and mouth opening, TheraBite contributes to the restoration of essential functions such as chewing, swallowing, and speech. This is particularly beneficial for patients aiming to regain oral function and quality of life post-treatment.</p></li><li><p>Patient Education and Support: Physiotherapists play a crucial role in guiding patients in the safe and effective use of TheraBite, ensuring proper technique and monitoring progress. They also provide education on self-care strategies and offer support throughout the rehabilitation process.</p></li></ol></div><p>TheraBite is a valuable adjunctive tool in the comprehensive rehabilitation of head and neck cancer patients, facilitating improved jaw function, reduced trismus, and enhanced quality of life. Its integration into personalized treatment plans underscores the multidisciplinary approach required to address the diverse challenges faced by individuals undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer [3].</p><h4 class='mt-4'>References:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><div class='history'><ol><li><p>Li T, Lu J, Yin Y, Qiu Q.

                sContent: "<p>The ability to engage with others is known as communication. In the realm of physiotherapy, through patient interaction, one can learn about the difficulties patients are having performing specific tasks. Also, a therapist is able to comprehend the psychological context of the patient and the extent of their disturbance. Additionally, the therapist can vocally encourage and build the patient's confidence. Effective communication is essential in physical therapy as it promotes trust, guarantees precise diagnosis, and streamlines treatment regimens.</p><p>Effective communication between the therapist and patients facilitates comprehension of exercises, methods, and goals of rehabilitation, hence improving patient compliance and results. Moreover, proficient communication fosters cooperation among medical experts, culminating in comprehensive patient care and enhanced general health.</p><p>Asking questions, confronting people, focussing, and verbally tracking are all forms of communication in physical therapy. Understanding when to employ each form is crucial for therapists. Therefore, it is not advisable to employ such a confrontation until a therapeutic relationship based on trust has been created.</p><p>Physiotherapists have to work with a specific patient for a minimum of six months and a maximum of one year. Thus, the therapist must use simple language that the patient can comprehend. Furthermore, the therapist will win over the trust of the patient—that is, the person with illnesses or injuries. They will bolster their confidence and inspire them. With the goal for the patient to make more of an effort and heal as quickly as feasible.</p><p>Core of the healthcare industry is communication. Establishing trust, verifying correct diagnosis, treatment plans, and patient compliance all depend on effective communication. Physiotherapists may establish a positive, upbeat environment that will inspire their patients by listening, empathizing, and giving thorough explanations. This will help them develop trust and rapport with their patients. Patients will feel more confident and motivated to achieve their goals as a result of this trust, which will also enable a more thorough grasp of their situation.</p><p>Physiotherapists can discover patients' problems by gathering important information by listening to patients describe their symptoms. With the assistance of a communication therapist, an accurate diagnosis and thorough assessment can be made. Nonverbal cues like body language can also be used in effective communication. Effective communication, education, and empowerment will enable patients to take an active role in their own rehabilitation by giving them the information and comprehension they need. Physiotherapists explain exercises using simple language, essential tools, and hands-on practice. This allows the patient to exercise correctly.</p><p>The therapist will encourage patients to promote exercises and lifestyle modifications by providing clear explanations, creating achievable goals, and providing support in order to ensure patient compliance through communication. Frequent communication also makes it possible to track development and make any required adjustments to treatment programs. The patient's psychosocial needs can be met by the therapist through interaction. A holistic approach is used by physiotherapists to address patients' physical, emotional, and social welfare as well as the psychosocial aspects of their experience, which include feelings like anxiety and fear.</p><p>By providing a secure environment for patients to communicate their worries and feelings, therapists help patients build confidence and trust. Furthermore, communication makes interdisciplinary collaboration easier, enabling therapists to work with other medical providers to meet patients' needs. To sum up, excellent communication is essential for physiotherapists to provide patients with quality therapy. The patient's life will eventually be improved by psychosocial education that promotes understanding, participation, and empowerment from the initial assessment through treatment planning.</p><p>Physiotherapists that possess great communication skills can form strong bonds with their patients, fostering physical rehabilitation and recovery to expedite the healing process.</p>"

The TMJ is a synovial, condylar, modified ovoid, and hinge type joint with fibrocartilaginous surfaces rather than hyaline cartilage and an articular disc. Gliding, translation, or sliding movements occurs in the upper cavity of the temporomandibular joint, whereas rotation or hinge movement occurs in the lower cavity. The capsule of the temporomandibular joint is thin and loose. In the resting position, the is slightly open, lips are together, and the teeth are not in contact but slightly apart. In the closed packed position, the teeth are tightly clenched, and the head of the condyles are in the posterior aspect of the joint. Centric occlusion is the relation of the jaw and teeth when there is maximum contact of the teeth, and it is the position assumed by the jaw in the swallowing. The position in which the teeth are fully integrated is called the median occlusal position. The temporomandibular joints are two of the most frequently used joints in the body, but probably receive the least attention. It has been shown that temporomandibular disorders affect 10% to 15% of adults. Without these joints, one would be severely hindered when talking, eating, yawning, kissing, or sucking. Temporomandibular disorders consist of several complex of multifactorial ailments involving many interrelating factors, including psychosocial issues. Oral lesions (herpes zoster, herpes simplex, oral ulcer), muscle overuse (clenching, bruxism), trauma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, headaches, and cancer pain can mimic temporomandibular joint disorders. Three cardinal features of temporomandibular joint disorders are orofacial pain, restricted jaw motion, and joint noise.(1)</p><p>The diagnosis of the temporomandibular joint dysfunction will be interpreted by the noise is assessed by the sound heard in stethoscope. A grafting sound indicates perforation of disk or arthritic changes. Limited opening suddenly resolved after click indicates disk displacement with reduction. Reducted ROM without clicking may be suggestive of disk displacement without reduction. The signs and symptoms of TMD disorders are pain and tenderness around jaw, Pain in one or both of the TMJs, pain in and around ear, difficulty in chewing or pain while chewing, locking of joint. Making it difficult to open or close the mouth, headache, neck pain, mental depression. The areas where pain of TMJ can radiate are temporalis, masseter, trapezius, sternoclenomastoid. (2) Goldfish Exercise was developed by Japanese Health Care Practitioner-SEIGO NISHI.</p><p>This exercise was an outcome of inspiration on the concept of elegant swimming motion of the Goldfish. When this concept was put into practice, the Japanese realized its benefits at many levels. This newly found way of exercising became known in Japan as “KINGYO UNDO” or “GOLDFISH EXERCISE”. The pain assessment in systematically is essential for correct diagnosis. This pain is a subjective part for both patient and health care professionals. So, require a valid and reliable tool for measurement of pain. VAS is widely used as a measure of pain intensity in globally. It has been shown that VAS is valid, reliable and interval scale. VAS has high test-retest reliability and repeatability. VAS is used in epidemiological and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of a variety of clinical symptoms. In randomized controlled trials, clinical trials VAS is frequently used to determine the effectiveness of treatment as an outcome measure.</p><p>Recently, there are different type of scale are used for assessing pain but without any valid (accurate) and reliable (reproducible) instruments it is very difficult to find real effect of treatment. The intensity of pain is a quantitative estimation and the most commonly used pain scales are the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) the Verbal Rating Scale (VRS). (3) The mouth opening is an important indication of the functionality of the temporomandibular joint. A limitation in the degree of opening can be symptom of TMJ dysfunction. It is usually defined as the distance between the incisor crests when the mouth is open maximum, or as the interincisal distance plus the overbite. The mouth opening is usually measured simply by asking the patient to their mouth open as wide as possible and measuring the distance between the edges of the frontal incisors with a ruler or calliper, and in some cases, the overlapping of the incisors is added.</p><p>All these methods have in common that the measurements is usually taken manually and are dependent on the experience of the professional taking them.(4) Temporomandibular joint disability index assesses pain and routine functional skills requiring oral functions. It has 10 sections of pain and disability during various activity. The patient was asked to circle the number which describes his problem best. Total scores out of 40 was calculated and converted into percentage.

The study utilized a interventional design, and data were collected in and around Amreli. the study included 60 tobacco chewing person. And divided into two groups. Group A recived goldfish exercise and group B was control group. The result of the study revealed significant differences exists between two groups they received the goldfish exercise and control group. Hence, the alternate hypothesis stating that there is significant differences between goldfish exercise and control group on tobacco chewing person can be accepted and the null hypothesis can be rejected. Subjects who recived goldfish exercise showed improvement with the outcome measure. Subjects who are in control group didn’t showed improvement with the outcome measure. But on comparing both the group. Group A seems more effective. The outcome measure will be used are used are VAS scale, TMJ disability index and increase in mouth opening. While the control group showed no statistical reduction on pain, TMJ disability index, mouth opening measurement. Goldfish exercise works on the principle of pulsatile motion of goldfish in water & thereby imitating the same motion for health benefits. It can be thought of stretching the fibrous bands, reducing TMJ stiffness & resulting in improvement in mouth opening. It would be beneficial to use this technique on daily basis and as far there are no contraindications of this exercise because it`s done with in pain limits& further progression depends on the mouth opening of the patient. Goldfish exercise can be given to the patients having jaw problems and even taught for home exercise program. However, there was a significant result was noticed in the Group A i.e. goldfish exercise, when t-test is performed to find out the effect.</p><h4 class='mt-4'>Conclusion:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>After collecting and analyzing the data which collected from in and around Amreli.

                sContent: "<h4>What is Sports Nutrition?</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>It can be defined as the application of nutrition knowledge to a practical daily eating plan focused on providing the fuel for physical activity, facilitating the repair and rebuilding process following hard physical work, and optimizing athletic performance in competitive events, while also promoting overall health and wellness.</p><div class='text-center'><img src='/assets/img/vol1_issue4_img1.png' alt='volume 1 - issue 4' class='img-fluid' /><p>The Nutrient Trio: Carbs, Proteins, Fats – A Dietary Dance</p></div><p>Carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water are recognized as essential nutrients. Within the body, carbohydrates are metabolized into glucose, serving as the primary energy source for all forms of physical exertion. These nutrients are abundant in a diverse range of foods, encompassing grains, fruits, vegetables, as well as various milk substitutes such as soy, rice, and nut-based beverages. Proteins, composed of amino acids, play a crucial role in the development, growth, and repair of muscles and other bodily tissues, making them vital for recovery following intense physical exercise. While proteins are present in many foods including grains and vegetables, they are predominantly found in dairy and dairy alternatives, along with meat and plant-based protein sources such as soy products, nuts, seeds, and legumes. Pre-workout meals should be high in carbohydrates and moderate in protein to provide energy and support muscle function. Post-workout meals should include protein to aid in muscle recovery and repair.</p><p>Fats, also referred to as lipids, are derived from both plant and animal sources in our diet. Triglycerides represent the most prevalent form of fat. Other types include cholesterol and phospholipids. Fats play a vital role in providing structural integrity to cell membranes, supporting hormone production, forming the insulating sheath around nerve cells, and aiding in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Fat primarily serves as an energy source during periods of rest and during low- to moderate-intensity physical activities. Chronic inflammation can lead to tissue damage and elevate the risk of injuries. Consuming certain foods, particularly those high in omega-3 fatty acids (such as fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts) and antioxidants (such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts), can help mitigate inflammation due to their anti-inflammatory properties.</p><h4>The Nutrient Superstars: Exploring the Vital Roles of Vitamins, Minerals, and Water:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Vitamins play a crucial role in a multitude of bodily functions and processes essential for maintaining health and preventing disease. They are categorized based on their solubility: water-soluble (including B vitamins and vitamin C) and fat-soluble (comprising vitamins A, D, E, and K), which influences their absorption, transportation, and storage within the body. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, are also known as energy nutrients, provide the body with energy. This energy is stored in the chemical bonds of these nutrients and released during metabolic processes that break them down into carbon dioxide and water. Some of this released energy is captured to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body's immediate energy source for cellular functions. The remaining energy is dissipated as heat. ATP is essential for muscle contraction and, without it, athletes could not perform physical activities. Vitamins are abundant in the diet, present across nearly all food groups such as fruits, vegetables, grains, meat and plant-based proteins, dairy and its alternatives, as well as certain fats. Collagen, a protein that provides the structural foundation for tendons, ligaments, and other connective tissues, relies on nutrients that support its synthesis. Foods high in collagen-boosting nutrients, like vitamin C found in citrus fruits, bell peppers, and strawberries, are beneficial for maintaining the health and integrity of these tissues, thereby reducing the risk of injuries such as tendonitis and ligament strains.</p><p>Minerals are essential for tissue development and the regulation of bodily processes. Physical activity stresses muscles and bones, increases the demand for oxygen transport in the blood, and results in sweat and electrolyte loss, necessitating sufficient mineral intake and replenishment. Minerals are divided into major minerals such as calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphorus, magnesium, and sulfur and trace minerals, including iron, zinc, copper, selenium, iodine, fluoride, molybdenum, and manganese. These minerals are predominantly found in meat, beans, and dairy products.</p><p>The body consists of 55–60% water, integral to nearly all tissues and fluids. In sports, water is crucial for regulating temperature, lubricating joints, and transporting nutrients to active tissues. Besides plain water, hydration can be maintained through beverages like juices, milk, coffee, tea, and water-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and soups. Dehydration can impair performance and increase the risk of injuries like muscle cramps and heat-related illnesses. Athletes should ensure adequate fluid and electrolyte intake before, during, and after exercise. Additionally, sufficient calcium and vitamin D are vital for bone health, reducing the risk of fractures and stress injuries. Athletes should consume calcium-rich foods, such as dairy products, leafy greensand obtain adequate vitamin D from sunlight and supplements if necessary.</p><div class='text-center'><img src='/assets/img/vol1_issue4_img2.png' alt='volume 1 - issue 4' class='img-fluid' /><p>Food pyramid for balanced diet for 2000 kcal (Image source: ICMR-NIN, Dietary guidelines for Indians)</p></div><h4>Nutritional Navigation: Navigating Dietary Guidelines for Optimal Health:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has updated its dietary guidelines for Indians, developed by a multidisciplinary committee of experts led by Dr. Hemalatha R, Director of ICMR-NIN. The revised Dietary Guidelines for Indians (DGIs) list seventeen specific recommendations, including consuming a variety of foods for a balanced diet, eating plenty of vegetables and legumes, and sourcing proteins from food items rather than commercial supplements. For a balanced diet of 2000 kcal, the guidelines recommend 500 grams of vegetables and fruits, 250 grams of cereals, along with pulses, legumes, fish or meat, and milk. The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) in Hyderabad warns that prolonged consumption of large amounts of protein powders or high-protein concentrates can lead to bone mineral loss and kidney damage. The guidelines also recommend that sugar intake should be less than 5% of total energy, with no more than 45% of calories from cereals and millets, and up to 15% from pulses, beans, and meat. The remaining calories should come from nuts, vegetables, fruits, and milk, with total fat intake not exceeding 30% of energy. Insufficient intake of essential nutrients can disrupt metabolism and increase the risk of insulin resistance and related disorders from an early age. The rise in consumption of highly processed foods high in sugars and fats, along with reduced physical activity and limited access to diverse foods, has exacerbated micronutrient deficiencies and obesity. The guidelines emphasize that ultra-processed foods like noodles, breakfast cereals, soup mixes, and cake mixes are unhealthy, even if enriched or fortified with nutrients.</p><p>It is estimated that 56.4% of India's total disease burden is due to unhealthy diets. Adopting healthy diets and physical activity can significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension, and up to 80% of type 2 diabetes.</p><h4>References:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><div class='mb-5'><ol><li><p>Practical Applications in Sports Nutrition, Seventh Edition Heather Hedrick Fink, Alan E.

The abdominal muscles are the muscles forming the abdominal walls, the abdomen being the portion of the trunk connecting the thorax and pelvis. An abdominal wall is formed of skin, fascia, and muscle and encases the abdominal cavity and viscera.<br /><br />It consists of four main muscles:</p><div><ol><li><p>Transversus abdominis</p></li><li><p>Rectus abdominis</p></li><li><p>External oblique muscles</p></li><li><p>Internal oblique muscles</p></li></ol></div><p>All the abdominal muscles have different muscle fibres orientation and act in all three planes during movements and are linked together by having a common site of connection or by fascia. Actions associated with abdominal muscle control can be complex. A single muscle does not usually work in isolation but in harmony with others. The abdominal muscles support the trunk, allow movement, hold organs in place, and are distensible (being able accommodate dynamic changes in the volume of abdominal contents).</p><p>The deep abdominal muscles, together with the intrinsic back muscles, make up the core muscles and help keep the body stable and balanced, and protects the spine. The most common traditional exercises) and training methods to enhance abdominal strength and stability employ body weight exercises consisting of static or dynamic contractions in various body positions (e.g., supine, lateral), starting with isolated movements and then continuing through with more complex sequences such as crunches, sit-ups, and planks (prone or lateral).</p><p>Correct breathing (especially as it involves the respiratory muscles) is vital to abdominal training because respiratory muscles are directly involved during common core stability exercises. DePalo et al. found that the diaphragm is actively recruited in many resistant training exercises, including sit-ups. Other studies demonstrated that the respiratory muscles are involved in a variety of activities in which respiration is not primarily involved. Because breathing is one of the most basic patterns directly related to human movement, as seen in neonates, inefficient breathing may result in muscular imbalance and motor control alterations that can affect general motor quality.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether, as compared with a training protocol of common exercises, abdominal training plus breathing exercises would more greatly enhance abdominal strength and endurance.</p><h4 class='mt-5'>SUBJECTS AND INCLUSION CRITERIA:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>All participants gave their consent via an online form after having been informed about the objectives and scope, procedures, risks, and benefits of the study.

The subject aims to sustain the pressure on the tester's fingers under the lower back by contracting the abdominals as the legs are lowered. During the test, if the pressure on your hand is decreased, stop the test and the angle is measured.<br /><br />The score is the angle of the legs in degrees from the floor. Below is a guide to scoring for this test :</p><table class='table table-responsive table-hover'><thead><tr><th>Angle</th><th>Rating</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>90 degree</td><td>very poor, starting position</td></tr><tr><td>75 degree</td><td>poor</td></tr><tr><td>60 degree</td><td>below average</td></tr><tr><td>45 degree</td><td>average</td></tr><tr><td>30 degree</td><td>above average</td></tr><tr><td>15 degree</td><td>good</td></tr><tr><td>0 degree</td><td>excellent, legs horizontal</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The two training protocols were administered for 20 minutes 4 times per week for 4 weeks in both groups; all exercises were performed after a standardised 10-minute warm-up.</p><p>The EG exercises were focused on achieving and maintaining a proper diaphragmatic breathing pattern for 2–3 seconds during inspiration and 8–10 seconds during expiration, with a vocal sound emitted to induce active deep internal abdominals. To do this, the subject inhales, expanding the lower abdominal region, the side and back of the abdomen, and the lower ribs. The chest is kept relaxed without pushing out the stomach, and the head is aligned with the spine to avoid excessive bending of the spine or body compensations.

Furthermore, the results suggest that a series of exercises performed with a vocal sound emission can be a valid strategy to enhance proper diaphragmatic breathing patterns and deep internal abdominal activation much more than in traditional abdominal routines in which people tend to hold their breath or use chest wall respiration.</p><p>Our results show that, while traditional core exercises can improve muscular strength and endurance, improvements are greater with muscular chain stretching in combination with breathing techniques.</p><p>As reported in previous studies, proper diaphragmatic breathing is directly linked to better functional movement, but combining proper breathing with global stretching postures can produce a greater effect. Regarding the biomechanical aspects of breathing, the expiration phase promotes active recruitment of the abdominal muscles, contrasting the natural elevation of the rib cage (induced by raising the arms overhead); to the contrary, elevating the arms raises the anterior chest wall, makes the thoracolumbar column hyperlordotic, and puts the diaphragm in an oblique position that inhibits its proper function. During exhalation, the thoracolumbar spine returns to a more neutral position (opposing the previous hyperlordosis), and the diaphragm is more horizontal without posterior pelvic tilt. The subject should inhale to expand the lower portion of the abdominal region, the side and back parts of the abdomen and lower ribs, keeping the spine aligned and the chest relaxed. Using a correct diaphragmatic breathing pattern promotes co-contraction of the abdominal muscles in the so-called bracing technique, which provides trunk stiffness and stability.</p><p>When focusing on diaphragmatic breathing, it is important not only to reestablish a correct respiratory pattern but also to ensure lumbar spine stabilisation by increasing intra-abdominal pressure and activation of the core structures to transfer forces from the centre of the body to the lower extremities. To produce an economic breathing pattern, all joints must be centred in a stable position to involve all muscular chains. The head, eyes, and spinal curves should all be aligned with the pelvis and the hips down to the knees and feet. This can be achieved with proper diaphragmatic breathing and adequate muscle tone distribution (as can be trained with EG exercises).</p><p><strong>LIMITATIONS:</strong></p><p>The present study has several limitations. The sample size was small, and the subjects did not belong to a specific population. Electromyographic assessment of the abdominal muscles was not performed. In addition, the control group exercise protocol was home based, the experimental group performed the exercises under observation.</p></div><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong><br /><br />In conclusion, EG exercises that incorporate correct breathing patterns and body flexibility offer an alternative to traditional abdominal exercises. As such, they may be useful for coaches or physical therapists when selecting core exercises to improve overall abdominal fitness and to retrain correct diaphragmatic breathing. Further research is needed to compare abdominal breathing with other core exercises in order to clarify the combination of breath and abdominal exercises in treating painful disorders (low back pain, neck pain) and improving motor control in fitness and rehabilitation programs which was not possible for this research due to limited time limit.</p>"

The prevalence of developing neck pain is 70%, posing future challenges to society. (1) A common cause of neck pain is development of Myofascial trigger points (MTrp) and unbalanced soft tissue around the head and neck structures that can limit the Range of Motion (ROM). (2-7)</p><p>MTrp is a condition, which is associated regional pain and muscle tenderness characterized by the presence of hypersensitive nodules within taut bands of skeletal muscles(8). Simons etal. defined MTrp as the presence of exquisite tenderness at a nodule in a palpable taut band of muscles. They are able to produce referred pain, either spontaneously or on digital compression and it is also reducing the joint ROM(9). Although MTrps are found in all muscle groups, they are more prevalent in the upper quarter postural muscles, especially the upper trapezius muscles and can cause local pain and may distribute the neck and shoulder girdle function in patients with neck pain(10,11,12). Therefore, the diagnosis and treatment of MTrps in muscles around neck especially upper parts of trapezius muscles is important with the aim of restoring soft tissue function or mobility to the joints in the patients with neck pain.</p><p>Physiotherapy is often considered the first treatment option for people with neck pain. Different therapeutic strategies, like Cervical spine mobilization and manipulation(13), Education(14), Thoracic manipulation(15) or Therapeutic exercises(16) have shown to be effective for the treatment of neck pain. However, the evidence supporting the use of other therapies proposed for the management of neck pain such as Dry needling and Active release technique and their combined effect is still limited.</p><p>Dry needling is invasive methods to treat MTrps. During Dry needling, a needle is inserted directly into the trigger points in the muscles without injecting a substance. Cummings TM et al stated that Dry needling consists of the insertion of needle in the active trigger points, by means of which an analgesics effect is obtained through the mechanical stimulus and the neurophysiological effect associated with the introduction of needle. Dommerholt J reported that Dry needling may mechanically cause the local sarcomere to stretch and the cytoskeleton structures inside the MTrps to contracts. It stimulates A-delta fibers and activates enkephalin-producing neurons in the dorsal horn, which leads to the reduction and suppression of pain. This is an effective way to reduce the somatic pain and disabilities that are associated with the MTrps in neck muscles(17). Active release technique (ART) is a manual therapy for the recovery of soft tissue function that involves the removal of scar tissue, which can cause pain, stiffness, muscle weakness and abnormal sensations including mechanical dysfunction in the muscle, myofascia and soft tissue(18). The effectiveness of ART has been reported for carpal tunnel syndrome, Achilles tendinitis, tennis elbow, all of which involve soft tissue near joints in the distal part of body(19). Dvord J et al stated that soft tissue injuries is the cause of pain in 87.5% of neck pain cases and ART is performed directly on the injured soft tissue to relieve pain.It is also effective in reducing pain and increasing pain in patients with a partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon(20).</p><p>Most patients with neck pain experience pain and movement limitations as a result of soft tissue impairment in neck. No previous studies have assessed how ART in combination with Dry needling can improve ROM and decrease pain in patients with neck pain. Also there are no literature available that shows which intervention should be given first during treatment of neck pain, i.e, either ART should encorporate prior to Dry needling or Dry needling should encorporate prior to ART to assess their combined effects.</p><p>Literatures are available which shows the effectiveness of both Dry needling and ART either Individually/isolate or with some other techniques but there’s no literature/research comparing the effectiveness between technique ART and Dry needling in patients with upper trapezius MTrps.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the combined effects of both techniques and assess which intervention should be given first on pain and ROM in upper trapezius MTrps with the aim of elucidating additional information on their effects and identifying more efficient treatments that can be used in clinical Settings.</p><h4 class='mt-5'>NEED FOR STUDY/RESEARCH GAP</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Neck pain is one of the most common health-related problems affecting economic productivity in modern society and researches into optimal treatment for neck pain is lacking. Previous studies have reported the application of Dry needling and ART with other therapeutic interventions for the treatment of neck pain but there are no studies available as per our knowledge to analyse the combining effect of Dry needling and ART in the treatment of neck pain or which technique is better in showing the best analgesic effect and in improving ROM in patients with neck pain. So, the need for this study is to compare the influence of both techniques (DN & ART) on upper trapezius MTrps as a useful intervention in the management to reduce neck pain and increase ROM.</p><h4 class='mt-5'>HYPOTHESIS:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong></p><div><ol><li><p>There will be no significant difference in pain and neck ROM following combined treatment of Active Release Technique and Dry needling in patients with neck pain.</p></li><li><p>There will be no significant difference in pain and neck ROM following individual treatment of Active Release Technique and Dry needling in patients with neck pain.</p></li></ol></div><p><strong>Experimental Hypothesis:</strong></p><div><ol><li><p>There will be a significant difference in pain and neck ROM following combined treatment of Active Release Technique and Dry needling in patients with neck pain.</p></li><li><p>There will be a significant difference in pain and neck ROM following individual treatment of Active Release Technique and Dry needling in patients with neck pain.</p></li></ol></div><h4 class='mt-5'>AIMS & OBJECTIVES:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>To know the combining effect of Dry needling and ART in the treatment of neck pain or which technique is better in showing the best analgesic effect and in improving ROM in patients with neck pain.</p><div><ol><li><p>To assess the effects of both techniques on Upper Trapezius muscles in neck pain patients to reduce pain, improve neck function and increase ROM.</p></li><li><p>To assess the combine effect of both techniques on Upper Trapezius muscles in the neck pain patients to reduce pain and increase ROM.</p></li></ol></div><h4 class='mt-5'>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>This study will be undertaken to compare the analgesics effects of Dry needling and Active Release Technique and to determine if Active Release Technique should incorporate before or after Dry needling in the treatment of neck pain associated with MTrps of upper trapezius muscle and identify which intervention is more efficient treatment that can be used in clinical settings.</p><h4 class='mt-5'>OPERATIONAL DEFINITION:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p><strong>Myofascial Trigger Points: -</strong><br />MTrPs are highly sensitive spots that lie in the skeletal muscle, and are diagnosed with mechanical pressure. Patients with MTrps are generally characterized by the presence of one or more of the following symptoms: local pain, referred pain according to a typical pattern, pain when exerting compression or stretch on the muscle, local twitch response (LTR) provoked by the snapping palpation of the taut band, reduced force, and decreased range of motion (ROM). A combination of these symptoms can result in less functionality and quality-of-life.</p><h4 class='mt-5'>ACTIVE RELEASE TECHNIQUE:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>According to Austin Sports Therapy, ART was developed by chiropractor Dr. P. Michael Leahy to work on a variety of muscle, tendon, ligament, fascia and nerve issues. In this technique deep digital pressure is applied over the tender point (trigger point) in a shortened position of the muscle and then patient is asked to actively take it in an opposite lengthened position. This will break the adhesions.</p><h4 class='mt-5'>DRY NEEDLING:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Dry needling consists of the insertion of a needle in the active trigger point, by means of which an analgesic effect is obtained through the mechanical stimulus and the neurophysiological effect associated with the introduction of the needle.</p><h4 class='mt-5'>VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>We used the VAS to evaluate the degree of neck pain. The VAS is a subjective scoring method for recording the degree of present pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most severe pain ever experienced) on a 10-cm scale.</p><h4 class='mt-5'>RANGE OF MOTION:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Passive ROM can be measured by fixing the subjects’s shoulder so that it will not be affected by the other parts of the trunk. Then, neck flexion, extension, right side bending, left side bending, right rotation, and left rotation can be measured The range of the angle can be measured with a therapist passively assessing the patients’s pain-free neck-joint ROM.</p><h4 class='mt-5'>NECK DISABILITY INDEX:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a commonly used health outcome measure to capture perceived disability in patients with neck pain.

The trapezius is particularly susceptible to damage by repetitive movements of the hand and arm while performing work such as using a computer for prolonged periods and poor posture. More of the study participants were right-handed and thus performed more movement of the right upper extremity than the left. ART by the literature is designed to accomplish three unique objectives: These are restoring free and unimpeded motion of soft tissues, release of entrapped nerve, vasculature and lymphatics thereby, re-establishing optimum texture, resilience and function of soft tissues. ART is a method for treating the soft tissues such as the tendon, nerve, and myofascial, and is performed for repetitive strain injury, acute injury, and functional fixation damage due to abnormal posture maintained over the long term. Furthermore, ART is an effective at resolving adhesion of scar tissues and the soft tissues that causes pain, spasm, muscle weakness, tingling, and other symptoms.</p><p>The use of ART, as echoed by many authors, is found to be a successful treatment option in soft tissue injuries and muscle pain like hamstring tightness and flexibility, Achilles tendinopathy, upper extremity overuse syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, adductor strain etc. The possible mechanism for this effectiveness may be that ART by virtue of mechanical stimulation causes a reactive hyperaemia and produces analgesic effect. Mechanical stimulation through digital pressure invokes the physiological response to cutaneous as well as muscular mechanoreceptors. This may alter the nociception and pain. With manual contact, mechanoreceptors may induce inhibitory effect on central nervous system which may result in decrease in H reflex. A patient also actively does the movement which increase the circulation and thus, reduction in pain and spasm may reduce the symptoms.</p><p>Robb et al. demonstrated immediate improvement of muscle PPT when ART was used to treat patients with adductor strain. Additionally, in a study by Tak et al. ART treatment for 3 weeks on the gluteus medius of a patient with low back pain for 3 weeks resulted in improvement of the patient’s VAS score and PPT. Although our target area differed from the studies of Tak et al. and Robb et al., significant improvement was observed in the VAS score, ROM and NDI after using ART to treat the neck muscles in the present study. It is my opinion that these improvements in VAS, ROM and NDI after treatment is the result of decreases in muscle tone after removing scar tissue adherent to soft tissue. In a study by James involving 20 young men with no injury of the lower extremity, hamstring flexibility increased immediately after ART was applied. Similarly, in the present study, ROM significantly increased and NDI score significantly decreased after ART was applied on the neck for alternate days of 1 week. This findings indicates that scar tissue, which can limit the mobility of soft tissue, can be removed by ART and thus relieve limitations of movements.</p><p>While in DN, There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of Dry needling (DN) as an intervention to MTrPs. Investigators have attributed the therapeutic effects of DN to various mechanisms, such as mechanical, neurophysiologic and chemical effects. It is thought that DN mechanically provides a localized stretch to the shortened sarcomeres and contracted cytoskeletal structures within the MTrPs. This would allow the sarcomeres to resume its resting length by reducing the degree of overlap between actin and myosin filaments. Simons et al stated that the main therapeutic factor for the effectiveness of DN is the mechanical disruption of the MTrPs by the needle and trigger points change in status from active trigger points to latent trigger point or probably normal tissues. DN can stimulate the A-delta nerve fibers, which in turn, may activate the enkephalinergic inhibitory dorsal horn interneurons, resulting in opioid-mediated pain suppression (pain relief). Some studies have also demonstrated that the increased levels of bradykinine, CGRP, substance P and other chemicals at MTrPs are directly corrected by eliciting LTR following DN. It has been suggested that DN may influence the microcirculation in muscles. Several investigators have demonstrated that needle insertion in the muscle may influence the microcirculation and enhance blood flow in the stimulated region. Previous studies have assessed the effects of DN on MTrPs in UT. However, samples and testing procedures, different results have been reported regarding the effects of DN on MTrPs in the UT. Abbaszadeh et al. and Ziaeifar et al. showed that DN administered to patients with MTrPs in the upper trapezius muscle significantly decreases the pain intensity and NDI and increases ROM. Gerber et al. demonstrated that the DN treatment of MTrPs in the trapezius muscles decreased the pain and increased ROM after each of three assessment sessions. Research has reported that DN may mechanically causes the local sarcomeres to stretch and cytoskeleton structures inside the MTrPs to contract. DN stimulates A-delta fibers and activates enkephalin-producing neurons in the dorsal horn, which leads to the reduction and suppression of pain. It has been shown that DN may affect the microcirculation of the skin and muscles, as well as change the chemical properties of MTrPs.</p><p>Similarly, in the present study, ROM significantly increased and NDI score significantly decreased after DN was applied on the neck for alternate days of 1 week. This findings indicates that MTrPS over UT causes pain, which can limit the mobility of soft tissue, can be removed by DN and thus relieve limitations of movements and disability (NDI) caused due to pain and painful ROM. In this study if we compare the effectiveness of both the intervention (DN & ART), DN has greater effects than ART to relief symptoms. There is no literature till date that demonstrated the effectiveness of combined intervention of DN and ART on MTrPs in the upper trapezius muscles. In this study I investigate the combined effects of DN and ART on MTrPs in the upper trapezius muscles which shows significant effect on VAS, ROM and NDI after alternate days of a week interventions of both the treatment protocols.</p></div><div><h4 class='mt-5'>LIMITATIONS OF STUDY</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>In this study, there was small sample size (40 patients) and lack of long-term treatment and follow-up. There was also heterogeneity of the sample in the relation to gender (22 females and 18 ), although, according to the 2011-2012 National Health Survey, there is a high prevalence of chronic cervical myofascial syndrome that appears more frequently in women (21.9%) than men (9.6%), which could be reflected in the study sample. Similarly, limitations of the study could be the wide ranges of ages between 18-85 years.In this study only unilateral affected side is considered. Another limitations is that treatment for neck pain focused exclusively on MTrPs of the upper trapezius muscles, and other muscles responsible for neck pain were not evaluated, although of all the targeted muscles are responsible for neck pain, trapezius is the most frequent.</p></div><div><h4 class='mt-5'>CONCLUSION: </h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Analgesic Effects of Dry Needling and Active Release Technique on Upper Trapezius Muscles in Neck Pain Patients.</br>The data collection of this study was conducted at Parihar Physiotherapy Centre under the supervision of Dr. S. D. Singh Parihar.</br>1. The result of this study suggested that, after 1st & 2nd weeks of Dry Needling, Active Release Techniques and combined intervention of both Dry Needling and Active Release Techniques on patients of neck pain resulting from upper trapezius trigger points shows a significant effects on pain, NDI and painful Range of Motion.</br>2. The result also showed that for the management of active trigger points of upper trapezius, Active Release Techniques can be effective and for the management of latent trigger points of upper trapezius, Dry Needling can be effective. </br>3. The result also suggested that combined intervention of Dry Needling and Active Release Technique is more effective than single intervention of either Dry Needling or Active Release Technique.</p></div>"

Additionally, this intelligent mobile device makes it easier for data from the Bio stamp sensors to be transferred to a cloud server for further evaluation. The Bio Stamp might upload its data to a nearby smartphone for analysis through near field communication (NFC), a wireless technology that allows devices to communicate data.

This paradigm aims to empower individuals by creating digital environments that are perceptive, flexible, and human-centered. Ambient aided technologies are those that utilize ambient intelligence to support assisted living. Ambient or in-home sensors may provide important information on the context and interactions of a person with their surroundings. A variety of environmental characteristics, including motion, light, temperature, pressure, and humidity, can be monitored with the use of ambient sensors. A range of sensors found in homes, including pressure sensors, webcams, and accelerometer can be used to identify anomalies such as falls and abrupt changes in activity. Additional uses for ambient house sensors include social isolation, stress, and loneliness monitoring.</p><p>In the last few years, ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies have become more and more popular, offering creative solutions to the problems associated with an aging population. In addition to supporting people in maintaining and pursuing their current activities, AAL technology has the potential to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of health and social services, as well as enable people to continue participating in activities at home and in the community as they age. Despite the lack of a consensus definition for AAL, the phrase 'ambient assisted living' is frequently used in gerontechnological research and development. There are three generations in the development cycle of ambient assisted living.</p><table class='table table-responsive table-hover table-bordered'><tbody><tr><td>1st Generation AAL</td><td>Connectable devices<br /> Reacts to an emergency<br /> Needs user to sound alarms, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>2nd Generation AAL</td><td>Sensors for the home<br /> May feel intrusive<br /> Automated detection and response to emergencies</td></tr><tr><td>3rd Generation AAL</td><td>Wearable devices and home sensor integration<br /> Assistance and tracking for prevention<br /> Less obstructive</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class='mt-4'>To enable people to live longer stay socially connected and age independently. AAL generally refers to the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT), stand-alone assistive devices, and smart home technologies into a person's everyday living and working environment. Through the integration of actuators, smart interfaces, artificial intelligence, and sensors, AAL creates supporting home environments. Traditional assistive technologies for individuals with disabilities, universal design approaches to accessibility, usability, and acceptability of interactive technologies, and the new ambient intelligence (AI) computing paradigm which offers pervasive, intelligent, and discrete assistance—are the foundations of AAL.</p><p>However, AAL technology has the potential to be adaptive to the varied nature of old age. It can anticipate and respond to the changing demands of older persons. Research on the possibilities of such technologies for healthy, frail, or dementia-stricken older persons has been limited to this point in AAL history. Research from the past has mostly overlooked how AAL technology might improve the daily lives of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). As long as daily activities are not hindered, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is described as a noticeable loss in cognitive ability (e.g., memory, decision making, problem solving, and understanding). Up to 15% of adults over the age of 65 experience it, making it a problem for an important portion of the elderly population.</p><p>For individuals with motor cognitive impairment (MCI), successful assistance for independent living and aging in place is especially important because, in the event that it fails, it may keep them from experiencing severe pain and/or the high expenses of specialized care. With no viable pharmaceutical option at this time, AAL is the most appealing choice for offering this kind of support. But attempts to propose treatments are complicated because MCI refers to a variety of illnesses that show differently and are poorly understood. AAL technologies that are designed to help older persons with cognitive impairments (mostly MCI) with the difficulties they face in their daily lives, as well as AAL technologies that could be more broadly beneficial to that target people. Leveraging advancements in IoT (Internet of Things), AI, and machine learning, ambient sensor technology are growing more complex and adaptable.

                sContent: "<h4>Introduction:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Physiotherapy is a dynamic field dedicated to restoring movement, function, and overall well-being. But at the heart of this practice lies not just technical expertise, but a powerful tool that guides informed decisions: clinical reasoning. It's a continuous cycle of inquiry, analysis, and adaptation, ensuring each patient receives a personalized approach to recovery.</p><h4 class='mt-4'>The Symphony of Clinical Reasoning:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Imagine a symphony where the patient's history forms the melody, the physical examination adds harmony and the physiotherapist's critical thinking acts as the conductor. Clinical reasoning orchestrates these elements into a cohesive treatment plan designed to address the root cause of the patient's dysfunction.</p><h4 class='mt-4'>The process unfolds in a cyclical fashion:</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>1. Data Collection:<br />History taking: This involves a comprehensive interview to understand the patient's presenting complaint, medical history, lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health.<br />Physical examination: Through various techniques, the physiotherapist evaluates movement patterns, joint integrity, muscle strength, sensation, reflexes, and other aspects relevant to the patient's condition.<br /><br />2. Hypothesis Generation: <br />Based on the gathered information, the physiotherapist formulates potential explanations for the patient's condition. These hypotheses should be grounded in current research evidence and consider the biopsychosocial model of health, encompassing biological, psychological, and social factors.<br /><br />3. Evaluation and Refinement:<br />The physiotherapist employs specific tests, observations, and sometimes even special investigations to confirm or refute the initial hypotheses. This stage might involve specific clinical tests, imaging referrals, or collaboration with other healthcare professionals for a more comprehensive picture.<br /><br />4. Treatment Planning:<br />Once a diagnosis is established, the physiotherapist designs a treatment plan tailored to the patient's specific needs and goals. This plan may include manual therapy techniques, therapeutic exercise prescription, education on pain management and self-care strategies, and potentially adjunctive therapies (e.g., modalities like ultrasound or electrical stimulation).<br /><br />5. Reassessment and Adaptation:<br />The physiotherapist continuously monitors the patient's progress and adjusts the treatment plan as needed. This iterative process ensures the treatment remains relevant and effective throughout the rehabilitation journey.</p><h4 class='mt-4'>The Power of Effective Clinical Reasoning</h4><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Mastering this intricate dance of information gathering, analysis, and intervention planning unlocks numerous benefits for physiotherapy care:<br />1. Improved Diagnostic Accuracy: Clinical reasoning leads to a deeper understanding of the underlying cause of dysfunction. By critically analyzing data and formulating well-defined hypotheses, physiotherapists can avoid mistaking symptoms for the root cause and design targeted treatments that address them.<br /><br />2. Individualized Care: Every patient presents with a unique story. Clinical reasoning allows physiotherapists to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. By considering the patient's specific needs, limitations, and goals, therapists can tailor treatment plans for optimal outcomes.<br /><br />3. Enhanced Patient Engagement: When patients understand the rationale behind their treatment plan and actively participate in decision-making, they become more invested in their rehabilitation journey. This collaborative approach fostered by clinical reasoning promotes ownership and empowers patients to actively participate in their recovery. <br /><br />4. Adaptability: The human body is a complex system, and situations can arise that deviate from textbook presentations. Strong clinical reasoning skills equip physiotherapists to think critically, adapt their approach on the fly, and adjust treatment plans as needed based on patient responses. Incorporating Clinical Reasoning into Practice: For aspiring and seasoned physiotherapists alike, fostering effective clinical reasoning requires a dedicated effort. Here are some practical steps to integrate this vital skill into daily practice:<br /><br />5. Build a Strong Knowledge Base: Staying current with the latest research findings and evidence-based practices is critical. A strong knowledge base allows physiotherapists to interpret data, formulate accurate hypotheses, and select appropriate interventions.<br /><br />6. Refine Active Listening Skills: Pay close attention to the patient's narrative. Listen not just to their symptoms, but also to their past experiences, current limitations, and desired outcomes. This information provides valuable clues for refining hypotheses and guiding the assessment process.<br /><br />7. Hone Observation Skills: Develop your ability to identify subtle details during physical examinations. Look for deviations in movement patterns, posture, muscle function, and joint integrity. These observations can significantly impact your clinical reasoning process and lead to more accurate diagnoses.<br /><br />8. Utilize Clinical Decision-Making Frameworks: Several frameworks can structure the clinical reasoning process. Some examples include the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) and the biopsychosocial model. These frameworks offer a systematic approach to analyzing patient data and formulating treatment plans.<br /><br />9. Embrace Reflection: Regularly evaluate your own decision-making processes. Reflect on successful cases and instances where the initial plan required adjustments. Consider what information was most helpful, what might have been missed, and how you could approach similar situations in the future.

Seek Collaboration and Continuous Learning: Don't hesitate to consult with colleagues, other healthcare professionals, or refer to specialists when needed.

Honesty and transparency build trust, and a willingness to explore different avenues showcases your commitment to finding the most effective approach.</p><p>Conclusion: Clinical reasoning in physiotherapy is not a rigid formula, but a dynamic process.
