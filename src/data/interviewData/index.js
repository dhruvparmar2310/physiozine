        sContent: '<h3>How is AI being integrated into physiotherapy, and what’s its impact on research, clinics, and academics?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>AI is creating waves in physiotherapy by reshaping how we work, learn, and innovate. In research, AI accelerates processes, such as analyzing large datasets, synthesizing evidence, and generating hypotheses. Clinically, it enhances patient care by tracking movement patterns, predicting outcomes, and providing insights into personalized treatment plans.</p><p>In education, AI helps to create interactive, adaptive tools that make learning more engaging and effective. However, it is not just about automation; AI is about augmentation, empowering us to do more while maintaining human expertise at the center.</p><h3>How can AI help researchers and physiotherapists do studies more accurately and efficiently?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>AI is a powerful tool for research. It can process massive amounts of data in minutes, identify trends, and suggest directions for further study. Tools, such as generative AI, assist with literature reviews, data visualization, and refining research questions. For physiotherapists, AI simplifies tasks, such as monitoring patient progress and analyzing outcomes. This saves time and ensures that our focus remains on interpreting the data and applying it to real-world scenarios, where it matters most.</p><h3>How can AI improve patient outcomes in physiotherapy?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>AI enhances patient outcomes by making care more precise and proactive. Wearable devices, for example, collect real-time data on a patient’s movements, and AI analyzes the data to adjust the therapy plans dynamically. AI also supports early detection, spotting potential setbacks or complications before escalating. It is a tool that ensures that every patient receives individualized care, helping them recover faster and more effectively.</p><h3>Is AI shaping physiotherapy education, and should it be part of the curriculum?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Yes, AI is transforming physiotherapy education, and it needs to be part of the curriculum. AI is already used to create adaptive learning tools, automate assessments, and simulate patient scenarios. However, it is more than simply learning how to use these tools. Students must understand how to evaluate AI outputs, think critically about them, and apply them responsibly. The shift from adapting to AI to becoming adept at leveraging is crucial for future professionals.</p><h3>What challenges do you see with AI adoption in physiotherapy?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The greatest challenges are access, trust, and training. Not every clinic or institution has the resources to invest in AI tools, and even when they do, there is often a steep learning curve for practitioners to feel confident in using them.Trust is another issue. Patients and clinicians alike must consider the reliability and fairness of AI-driven recommendations. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing education, transparent communication, and the validation of the tools used.</p><h3>What ethical concerns come up when using AI in physiotherapy?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Ethics are a critical part of the adoption of AI in physiotherapy. Data privacy is a top concern—AI systems often rely on sensitive patient information; therefore, protecting that data is essential. Bias is another issue. If AI models are trained on incomplete or skewed data, their outputs may not be equitable or effective for all the populations. Transparency is a key factor in this process. Patients need to understand how and why AI is being used in their care, and clinicians must remain accountable for decisions, ensuring that AI serves as a support tool, not the decision maker.</p><h3>How could misuse of AI hurt the field of physiotherapy?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Misusing AI, such as relying on it blindly without validation, can lead to incorrect diagnoses or ineffective treatment. This could harm patients and erode their trust in the technology and profession. AI is an aid and not a replacement. Misuse occurs when we treat it as an answer instead of a tool to enhance our expertise. We need to be mindful of where and how to use it.</p><h3>Will AI replace physiotherapists?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>No, AI will not replace physiotherapists. However, physiotherapists who do not embrace AI may find themselves replaced by those who do so. AI augments our capabilities and does not take over our roles. Currently, it handles repetitive tasks, such as analyzing data or tracking progress. In the future, as automation advances, certain tasks may become fully automated. However, the heart of physiotherapy—building trust, adapting care, and delivering empathy—remains human. Those who adopt AI will lead the way forward.</p><h3>Where do you see AI in the next 10 years?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>AI is expected to become deeply embedded in physiotherapy. Wearables and predictive models are standard tools for personalizing care, while automation handles routine tasks, freeing clinicians to focus on complex decision-making. The metaverse plays a significant role in physiotherapy education, clinical practice, and research. We will see virtual environments in which students practice on simulated patients, clinicians deliver remote therapy sessions, and researchers conduct controlled studies in immersive settings. In addition, robotics has advanced significantly. AI-driven robotic devices will support precision therapy and rehabilitation, making treatment more effective and accessible. AI and these technologies will redefine how we approach patient care, research, and education while maintaining human connections at the center.</p><h3>How can physiotherapists and researchers integrate AI responsibly?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Start small and learn continuously. Experiment with AI tools for specific tasks like data analysis or patient monitoring, and focus on understanding their strengths and limitations. Ethics must be at the forefront—protect data privacy, validate AI outputs, and remain transparent with patients and colleagues. The key is to use AI for augmentation, not automation—enhancing our ability to deliver care while keeping human expertise and empathy at the heart of our practice.</p><h3>QUOTES :-</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p class="text-center">"The metaverse will be a key player in physiotherapy, enabling virtual environments for education, research, and clinical practice. Combined with AI and robotics, these tools will redefine how we deliver care while keeping human connection at the center."</p>'

        sContent: "<p>Life is full of twists, turns, and challenges that shape us into the people we are  meant to become. Looking back, I can see how each step of my journey—whether  it was in the classrooms of Pune, the streets of Dallas, or the bustling avenues of  New York City—has contributed to the healthcare professional I am today. But  this journey wasn’t without its share of struggles, sacrifices, and moments of  doubt. Yet, through it all, one thing remained clear: my deep passion for the human  body, for healing, and for helping others.</p><h3 class='mt-4'>The Spark of a Dream: From India to Global Aspirations </h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>I was born and raised in India, a country rich in culture and tradition, where the  importance of family is paramount. While I valued my roots, I always felt an  innate pull toward something beyond the boundaries of my immediate  surroundings. My love for biology and the intricate systems that govern the human  body began early. I was fascinated by how the body moves, heals, and adapts—an  obsession that led me to pursue a Bachelor’s in Physiotherapy at Dr. D.Y. Patil  College in Pune.</p><p>I arrived at college with a singular goal: to excel. From the very first semester, my  ambition was clear. I was determined to not only learn but to lead. In a class of 100  students, I stood out by earning the highest grades, securing a gold medal for my  academic achievements. But while academic success was important, I believed that  a well-rounded education was just as valuable. So, I dove into student leadership  roles, cultural events, and sports competitions. It was during this time that I  realized that my journey would require not just academic rigor, but also the ability  to balance hard work with joy, leadership with service, and responsibility with  creativity.</p><p>In my final year, I ran for President of the Student Council—a role that came with  immense responsibility. I managed inter-state and national events, worked  tirelessly to represent my peers, and, of course, faced sleepless nights juggling my  academic responsibilities. But, in the end, the hard work paid off. I was honored to  be named the Valedictorian of my batch in 2020, a title that recognized not just my academic achievements, but my contribution to the college community.</p><h3 class='mt-4'>Taking a Leap of Faith: Moving from India to the U.S.:</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>After graduation, I was ready to take the next step—further my education, broaden  my horizons, and experience the world beyond the borders of India. The United  States was the natural choice for my next chapter, but convincing my family  wasn’t going to be easy. As the first woman from my town considering studying  abroad, my decision was met with a mix of support and concern. My parents  worried about my safety, the distance, and the unfamiliarity of a new country.  Similarly, my principal, Dr. Tushar Palekar, was understandably hesitant. He had  watched me grow and felt an attachment to my academic journey at D.Y. Patil  College, and the thought of me leaving was difficult for him to process.</p><p>But I knew this was my calling. With the backing of mentors who had guided me  to this point, and the encouragement of my parents who eventually recognized my  drive and determination, I set my sights on a Master’s in Kinesiology and Exercise  Sciences in Dallas, Texas. The transition wasn’t easy. I arrived in the U.S. alone— no family, no familiar faces. It was the first time I truly felt what loneliness meant.  The culture, the environment, the people—they were all new to me. Yet, adversity  breeds resilience, and slowly, I made new friends, adapted to my surroundings, and  found strength in my journey.</p><h3 class='mt-4'>A New Chapter in Leadership: South Asian Student Association  (SASA):</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>It was during this time that I was approached by the former president of the South  Asian Student Association (SASA), a prominent student organization in Dallas.  She saw something in me—my energy, my drive, my ability to connect with  people—and invited me to take over the presidency. At first, I hesitated. I was  already managing a full academic load, grappling with the pressures of a new  culture and lifestyle. But after several requests, I agreed to take on the role. </p><p>Being president of SASA added another layer to my growth. It wasn’t just about  cultural representation; it was about fostering community, celebrating diversity,  and making an impact on my peers. Organizing events, leading discussions, and providing a support network for students from all over the world helped me grow  as a leader and a person. It was a transformative experience that taught me the  power of service and the importance of building bridges between cultures.</p><h3 class='mt-4'>The PT License Exam: A Milestone in My Career</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>While leadership roles were important, the heart of my professional journey lay in  physical therapy. In the U.S., passing the Physical Therapy (PT) License exam for  New York was a monumental challenge. The exam required months of rigorous  preparation, with long hours of study and little sleep. I was determined to pass on  my first attempt, so I pushed myself harder than ever before. After weeks of  sacrifice, the day I received the notification that I had passed was one of the most  satisfying of my life. </p><p>Soon after, I secured an internship in New York City, just two blocks from the  iconic Radio City Music Hall—a location that symbolized everything I had worked  for. The internship allowed me to work with some of the best in the field, honing  my skills and gaining invaluable real-world experience. But the real turning point  came after the internship ended, when I was offered a full-time position at a clinic  in Jackson Heights, New York.</p><h3 class='mt-4'>Becoming a Clinician: Specializing in Sports Injuries &  Rehabilitation:</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>For the past two years, I’ve had the privilege of working under Liza Tan, an  employer who has become a mentor and friend. Liza’s commitment to integrity,  culture, and faith mirrors my own values, and I’m proud to be part of a practice  that prioritizes patient care above all else. As the Clinic Manager at Jackson  Heights Outpatient Orthopedic Clinic, I specialize in treating a variety of  musculoskeletal conditions, particularly sports injuries. From athletes with soccer,  basketball, and tennis injuries to patients recovering from surgeries like ACL,  rotator cuff repairs, and hip replacements, my role requires both clinical expertise  and emotional intelligence.</p><p>Each patient is unique, and my goal is to provide tailored care that ensures the  highest possible level of recovery. Using evidence-based physical therapy,  combined with holistic manual techniques like Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy, I  help patients restore their function, alleviate pain, and improve their quality of life.  Whether it’s guiding someone through post-surgical rehabilitation or working with  athletes to recover from a sports injury, every success story adds another layer to  my passion for physiotherapy.</p><h3 class='mt-4'>Building a Legacy of Education and Empowerment:</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>While my clinical practice continues to grow, my passion for education and giving  back to the community is equally important. In 2023, I launched the Let’s Talk  About Health by Bhavna podcast. The show was born out of a desire to create a  platform where healthcare professionals could share their journeys, discuss  challenges, and offer insights into the world of healthcare. The podcast has become  a space for learning, collaboration, and inspiration, with over 150 guest speakers to  date, including doctors, therapists, trainers, and more. The podcast is more than just a learning resource—it’s a community. Through it,  I’ve connected with healthcare professionals across the globe, bringing diverse  perspectives on topics ranging from injury prevention to mental health in  rehabilitation. One of the greatest rewards of hosting this podcast is knowing that  I’m helping the next generation of physiotherapists navigate their careers,  equipping them with the knowledge and inspiration they need to succeed.</p><h3 class='mt-4'>Key Achievements & Contributions:</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Host of Let’s Talk About Health by Bhavna Podcast: Over 150 guest speakers  have joined me in conversations on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Apple  Podcasts, and Spotify, covering topics related to healthcare, rehabilitation, and  wellness. Webinars for PhysioEdd: Conducted multiple webinars aimed at guiding aspiring  physiotherapists in India and Australia on pursuing careers in healthcare and  learning from the experiences of professionals abroad.  International Speaker at Virtual Physio Conference (2024): Delivered a talk on  injury prevention and rehabilitation, emphasizing proactive healthcare practices in  sports and physical therapy. Guest Speaker on Podcasts like Physio Social Club (Australia) and Wellness  Debunked (Canada): Shared my cross-cultural experiences in physical therapy and  debunked common myths about pain and recovery.  Guest Speaker at International Healthcare Conferences: Invited to speak at events  in Australia, Canada, and Italy, discussing the integration of physical therapy  practices across cultures and educating future healthcare leaders.</p><h3 class='mt-4'>Looking Ahead: A Lifelong Journey of Learning and Giving Back:</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>As I look to the future, I am more committed than ever to pushing the boundaries  of what I can achieve. My goal is to continue developing my clinical skills, expand  my platform for education, and build a global community of healthcare  professionals who can collaborate and learn from one another. I want to be a  catalyst for change in the healthcare industry, using my voice and my practice to  promote holistic healing, innovation, and lifelong learning. This journey—from India to the U.S., from physiotherapy student to clinician and  educator—has been both a professional and personal odyssey. But through every  challenge, every leap of faith, and every success, I’ve learned that the most  important lesson of all is this: the road to greatness is never easy, but it is always  worth it.</p>"

        aSocial: {},
        sContent: "<h3>What inspired you to pursue research in physiotherapy?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>I came into physiotherapy academics quite late in my life. My colleagues had already created a niche area in their respective fields of Musculo-skeletal physiotherapy, Cardio-respiratory conditions or paediatrics or neurology. I was wondering what I should specialise in. I joined MPT at the age of 40. We were the first batch of post-graduation at SBB college, Ahmedabad and Gujarat still did not have many PG teachers at that time. Our teachers were trying hard to do the best for us. Gujarat had a lack of exposure to research at that time. We faced problems in our research project because of this lack of knowledge and exposure. I took that up as a challenge that why should research be so difficult to understand, questioning myself at various stages of the dissertation and trying to find answers. This lit the interest for research in me. I am grateful to my post graduate guide, and Principal, Dr Neeta Vyas for giving me opportunities to increase my knowledge in this field. Two inspirations were the late Dr. Lata Shroff madam and Dr. Rajani Mullerpattan. Dr. Jasprit Kang was the first to give me a platform to talk on research and Dr. Balaganapati gave me an opportunity to talk on Evidence Based Practice which increased my confidence in this field. Dr Yagna Shukla, Dr Anjali Bhise, Dr Nehal Shah, and Dr Bhavana Gadhvi among others, have been constant supporters in my journey of more than 25 seminars/workshops on research in the last 10 years.</p><h3>Why is research important in the field of physiotherapy?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>We are in an era of Evidence-based Practice (EBP). EBP is based on three pillars – evidence, physiotherapist experience and patient views. Evidence tells us what works and what does not. We can then use the evidence that works on our patients. To read and understand research, a basic step is having done at least one research project. There is a need to critically appraise the evidence that is available and only them apply it clinically. We do not need to believe all conclusions that are available online but we need to understand how was the research done, the reliability of the results and the validity of the methodology. So, research is not only important academically but it is done so clinical practice can be guided by relevant and well conducted research.</p><h3>What are the key benefits of conducting research for physiotherapy professionals?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>One of the key benefits for physiotherapy students is completion of their coursework. Research is now compulsory in many universities at the undergraduate level. It has always been a partial fulfilment requirement for post-graduation. The award of the PhD degree is based only on the defence of a research proposal.</p><p>For physiotherapy professionals, research is a medium of self-appraisal for promotion in academic jobs. Performing research helps in better understanding of application of other researches. It teaches us management skills like multi-tasking, time management, communication skills etc. Thus, it contributes to the growth of the therapist. Presenting and publishing research increases self-confidence and is a permanent mark of contribution in the field. It is our duty as a physiotherapist to work towards the upliftment of the profession.</p><h3>What factors should one consider when selecting a research topic in physiotherapy?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Selecting a research topic is the biggest challenge in doing research. Firstly, because physiotherapy is a clinical branch, academics or undergraduate training teaches us how to do clinical practice but does not incorporate research for many. And secondly somewhere at the back of the mind, we are afraid of research, not ready for it. Research also involves statistics. We as physiotherapists do not like maths, so statistics is not our cup of tea. The qualities of a research question include the following (FINER and SMART)-</p><div><ul><li><p>Feasibility – It should be possible to conduct the research from the point of view of population, materials, expertise etc. and the goals should be Achievable.</p></li><li><p>Interesting – The topic should be of interest to the researcher and reader both.</p></li><li><p>New – in line with current trends</p></li><li><p>Ethical – The research should be of benefit to the participant and not harm them. It should not increase the pain or have an associated risk of injury to the participant.</p></li><li><p>Relevant – It should be a relevant topic to physiotherapy and society</p></li><li><p>Specific – The question should be focussed, to get a specific answer.</p></li><li><p>Measurable – The question should have an outcome which can be measured. The outcomes used to measure the effect of the method should be valid, reliable, sensitive, specific. The RQ should be answerable.</p></li><li><p>Time-bound – When research is compulsory it is time-bound. We need to select topics that can be completed in a stipulated time of 6 months, 2 years, 5 years.</p></li></ul></div><h3>What role does clinical experience play in choosing a research topic?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Clinical experience plays an important role. Research is a connection between academic capabilities and clinical problems. Problems faced in clinical work can be taken up as research topics to come up with solutions. This helps in building the resume and finding answers to clinical queries. Experience will also be useful in forming the methodology - the common patients, common presentations can be used to formulate the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The final topic title depends on the method, So, clinical experience will help in fulfilling the criteria of feasibility, relevance, specificity of a research question.</p><h3>How important is it to align the research topic with current trends and advancements in physiotherapy?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>If we look at the criteria of a good research topic being new and interesting, we need to focus on advancements in physiotherapy. Performing research on already known topics and conclusions ends up in a waste of time and resources of the therapist and the time of the reader and participants of the research. The relevance of the topic is more when the topic is a current trend, as the clinical question arises whether the new treatment is effective or not. Research is also needed about an advancement with respect to various parameters, validity in various groups with respect to conditions and age groups.</p><h3>What are the initial steps a physiotherapist should take when deciding on a research topic?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>A firm decision to conduct research is the first step to completing a project. To think about the topic is the most difficult step. Once a broad area is decided, extensive literature search is to be done. This helps to understand the information that is already available, related to the topic. Relevant literature needs to be appraised, to understand the validity of existing research and the gaps in research. Reviewing the literature, helps in the formation of the research question and developing the need of the study, and in developing the methodology. The next step is deciding the attributes of methodology. The population, study design, intervention and outcomes will be part of the topic. Once the methodology is finalised, the research topic needs to be revised based on the method.</p><h3>How can one narrow down broad ideas into a feasible research question?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>A research question which is not specific leads to unfocussed literature search. The research will end up with a vague answer. A researcher usually begins with a vague question, pertaining to a large area. The PICO format, involving the Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome helps to narrow done the area. Defining the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the participants from the population, details about the intervention and the comparative modality, and description of how the effect is going to be measured i.e. which outcomes are going to be used will narrow down a broad idea into a feasible research topic. The PICO format is used only in experimental studies. Observational studies need details of the population and the outcomes that will be used.</p><h3>What resources (journals, conferences, mentors, etc.) can help in selecting an appropriate topic?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>A guide or mentor who is experienced in research serves as the best source of guidance to decide a research topic, so that it fulfils the criteria of feasibility and relevance. The ocean of information available at the tips of fingers is a resource of valuable information as well as it confuses the novice researcher who lacks knowledge of appraisal of literature. Databases provide access to journals and articles but the quality and validity of the research may be a question. These resources need to be used with the experience of appraisal. Conferences are sources of updated topics of research which can be carried forward. An inquisitive mind is the biggest resource for questions along with clinical experience. Topics that interest the researcher should be selected.</p><h3>What common challenges do physiotherapists face when selecting a research topic? How can these challenges be effectively overcome?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><div><p>Challenges are a part of doing research. Common mistakes that are done and which can be avoided are -</p><ul><li><p>Selection of a wrong topic – one which does not fulfil the criteria of being FINER and SMART</p></li><li><p>Inadequate expertise of the technique of intervention, resulting in inadequate results – can be overcome by learning the physiotherapy techniques to be used</p></li><li><p>Inadequate knowledge of research and statistics – can be overcome by approaching knowledgeable people or reading statistics. It should be kept in mind that a badly done statistics can be made better with the help of a statistician, but a badly planned methodology cannot be saved or made better by any amount of expert help from a statistician. So, focus on good research methodology. The rest will be taken care of</p></li><li><p>Unavailability of patients to complete the required sample size – can be avoided by a correct selection of the population/ sample</p></li><li><p>Inadequate availability of literature to base the study on or justify results – can be overcome by proper searching of databases</p></li><li><p>Finances depending on the budget – Can be borne by the researcher or grants and funds can be approached.</p></li><li><p>Time management and completion of the project – the solution is planning using tools like a GNATT chart etc.</p></li></ul></div><h3>How should ethical considerations influence the selection of a research topic?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>As researchers in physiotherapy, we need to remember that our research involves human beings. Ethics protects people from being used solely for the advantage of research. Research questions that are being studied should not harm the patient (non-maleficence) and should benefit the participant or society (beneficence). Research should involve autonomy (informed consent) and confidentiality (identity is not disclosed) among other principles of ethics.</p><h3>What practical factors (time, resources, funding) should be considered?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Human resources are needed for good quality studies which involves therapist and assessor blinding along with blinded allocation. This is possible only if the research involves more researchers. We also need an adequate sample size to maintain the power of the study.</p><p>Funding of the research is to be considered before the start of the study. The first question is what are the expenses that will be incurred and next is who will bear this expense. Will it be borne by the researcher or are you applying for funding or grants. If there is any funding then is there any conflict of interest involved by the funding party where the results should favour them.</p><p>Time management is crucial or the research project does not see the light of day. Planning is needed so data collection and writing can be completed on time.</p><h3>What advice would you give to young physiotherapists who are looking to start their research journey?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Start with small research topics which can be completed without many hurdles. Plan the proposal well, spend time on the planning and revise the proposal so that no problems come up later. Publish what you do. Research may seem difficult when you begin, but it is not impossible. Do what you like, so you will want to do it.</p><h3>How can physiotherapists ensure their research contributes meaningfully to the profession?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>When the research topic selected is new, interesting, relevant, and valid, the new information that comes out of the research will definitely be meaningful and contribute to the growth of the profession.</p><h3>What are some emerging areas in physiotherapy research that professionals should explore?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Research related to new technology using techniques like Artificial intelligence, machine learning techniques, robotics, cognitive computing, virtual reality, and augmented reality is now emerging. Innovative ideas in the above along with wearable devices, feedback methods, telehealth, mobile health apps, gaming technology can be explored. Biomechanics and movement analysis use updated technology for better data collection. Effects of combining physiotherapy with complementary therapies can be studied. Collaborations with various fields can also be explored for better results. Thus the field for research in physiotherapy is ever expanding with no boundaries.</p>"

        sContent: "<h3>Can you describe your experience in providing physiotherapy care to COVID-19 patients?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>The first cases of this predominantly respiratory viral illness were reported in late December 2019 in the Chinese province of Hubei, which is located near Wuhan. Because of its rapid spread, the World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.</p><p>I always worked on mobility of the patient of COVID-19 and involved in the planning of invasive or non-invasive ventilation of COVID-19 patient Additionally, we were also addressed the severe cases of out-patient department and involved in the Tele-rehabilitation practice during COVID-19.</p><p>I actively involved in the management of COVID-19 patients from the acute to the rehabilitation phase and provided essential care to patients with respiratory problems, mobility limitations, and other impairments caused by the virus. Additionally, I was also having role in educating patients and families about COVID-19 and providing psychological support as well.</p><p>So overall indeed it was a magnificent experience between life &amp; death where motivation and urge to do something for the patients from ventilator to weaning off.</p><h3>What were the most common respiratory and musculoskeletal complications you encountered in post-COVID patients?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Some people may feel short of breath. People with chronic heart, lung, and blood diseases may be at risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and acute respiratory failure and the musculoskeletal involvement due to medications used for the treatment of COVID-19, and in the post/long COVID-19 syndrome are fatigue, myalgia/arthralgia, back pain, low back pain, and chest pain.</p><h3>How did physiotherapy interventions help in improving lung function and overall recovery in COVID-19 patients?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Considering that most patients of COVID-19 requiring ICU care have respiratory involvement, we aim to explore whether cardiac rehabilitation is an effective intervention in these patients to improve outcomes and reduce mortality. which includes clearance of airway by bagging &amp; suctioning , exercise training, education, and behavior change, designed to improve the physical and psychological condition of people with chronic respiratory disease and to promote the long- term adherence of health-enhancing behaviors.</p><p>Participation in cardiac rehabilitation- enhances exercise capacity, reduces depression and anxiety, improves Health Related Quality of life, fatigue, and the strength of respiratory muscles in patients with various forms of respiratory disorders. These improvements are observed in patients with COPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, stroke. and lung cancer.</p><p>Also, cardiac rehab have role in survivors of ARDS, obesity-related respiratory disorders, before and after lung resection, and respiratory impairment related to spinal cord Injury.</p><h3>What specific rehabilitation techniques did you use for patients with post-COVID fatigue and breathlessness?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>To reduce dyspnea, improve lung capacity, decrease the level of anxiety, stress, and depression, as well as increase the muscle strength affected by this disease by multiple exercise program oriented toward removing secretions in the airways and obtaining a re-education of the respiratory pattern (control of breathing, chest expansion, and expiration) in order to improve the respiratory volume and the oxygen saturation.</p><p>The Debit Controlled Inspiratory Exercises (EDIC) and autogenic drainage are addressed to improve the ventilation-perfusion ratio (V/Q) and decreasing the fatigue, with a reduction of the tendency to develop bronchospasm.</p><p>Aerobic and strengthening exercises play a key role in enhancing cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal performance.</p><p>These helps to restoring and improving the quality of life of the population affected by COVID.</p><h3>Were there any challenges in delivering physiotherapy care during the pandemic, especially with safety protocols and patient compliance?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>During the COVID-19 epidemic, providing physical therapy care faced a number of difficulties with regard to patient compliance and safety procedures.</p><div><ul><li><p>Access to in-person care was restricted as a result of numerous physiotherapy clinics temporarily closing or operating at reduced capacity. Impact: Treatment delays or gaps for patients with acute injuries or chronic diseases exacerbated their conditions.</p></li><li><p>The transition to telehealth was challenging because patients and therapists had limited access to technology or were unfamiliar with virtual platforms. The difficulty or impossibility of doing some hands-on therapies raised questions regarding their effectiveness.</p></li><li><p>Therapists had to wear face shields, gloves, and masks, which could impede visibility and make it difficult to communicate effectively. Patient results and satisfaction were impacted by the difficulty in interpreting spoken instructions and physical clues.</p></li><li><p>Physiotherapy frequently necessitates intimate interaction, which makes social distance challenging or impossible during sessions.Without providing patients with direct physical support, therapists had to come up with innovative ways to tackle them.</p></li><li><p>Higher Standards for Cleaning and Disinfection and improving cleanliness in between sessions, fewer patients could be seen in a single day.There were additional scheduling and appointment restrictions, which resulted in backlogs and care delays.</p></li><li><p>Number of patients cancelled appointments or failed to attend follow-up appointments because they were terrified of being exposed to COVID-19.This avoidance resulted in deteriorating circumstances or a reversal of the recovery process.</p></li><li><p>Some patients refused to comply with safety protocols or wear masks. This damaged the therapy connection by causing disagreements and putting staff and other patients at risk.</p></li><li><p>Safety worries, fewer patients, and the pressure to adopt new procedures all contributed to therapists&#39; increased stress levels.Therapist performance and overall treatment quality were impacted by this</p></li><li><p>The challenge of home exercise compliance was that patients were less likely to stick to their regimens without the face-to-face accountability of scheduled sessions. Setbacks or little progress were made, particularly for patients undergoing long-term rehabilitation.</p></li><li><p>Vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, injured, and immunocompromised, needed extra safety measures and frequently couldn&#39;t make it to in-person meetings. Due to a lack of consistent care, these individuals were more likely to lose their independence or mobility.</p></li></ul></div><h3>How did you modify traditional physiotherapy approaches to adapt to tele-rehabilitation for COVID-affected patients?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><div><ul><li><p>Video observations of posture, gait, movement patterns, and range of motion were used in place of more conventional hands-on evaluations. In order to collect the required data, patients were instructed to do self-assessments (such as assessing flexibility or palpating sensitive areas) under the observation of a therapist.</p></li><li><p>In place of gym equipment, customized workout programs were created using everyday objects (such as chairs for balance training or water bottles as weights). The therapist provided real-time corrections and modifications while the exercises were completed and taught via video conversations.</p></li><li><p>Therapists focused more on teaching patients how to manage their conditions, treat discomfort, and perform activities correctly. In addition to virtual sessions, there were clear written instructions, workout videos, and smartphone apps available.</p></li><li><p>Using wearable technology, apps, or self-reported progress logs, therapists were able to monitor and monitor patients&#39; progress and adherence remotely. Accountability was guaranteed by frequent video check-ins, which also made it possible to modify treatment programs in response to patient input and progress.</p></li><li><p>In order to increase lung capacity and lessen dyspnea, patients with COVID, particularly those exhibiting respiratory symptoms, were advised to perform breathing exercises.Under live observation, patients practiced diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing methods as therapists demonstrated them electronically.</p></li><li><p>Therapists advised changing home settings for patients who were at risk of falling (e.g., removing rugs, ensuring enough lighting).Therapists watched and gave feedback via video while participants conducted balance exercises supported by walls or furniture.</p></li><li><p>Stretching exercises, foam rolling, or patient-led self-massage were used in place of manual therapy procedures.By teaching patients relaxation techniques and heat/cold therapy, therapists helped patients manage their pain at home.</p></li><li><p>Tele-rehabilitation sessions incorporated more motivational coaching. To keep patients interested during virtual sessions, therapists fostered a cooperative, encouraging atmosphere.</p></li><li><p>To stay in touch therapists made use of video conferencing tools, messaging applications, and secure healthcare platforms.To illustrate exercise adjustments or explain anatomical ideas, virtual whiteboards or screen-sharing tools were employed.</p></li><li><p>Family members were frequently asked to promote mobility training as part of collaborative care and family involvement modifications. In order to aid patients safely and without hurting them, caregivers received training during sessions.</p></li></ul></div><h3>Did you notice any long-term effects of COVID-19 that required extended physiotherapy care? If so, what were they?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Indeed, a large number of patients needed prolonged physiotherapy care due to the long-term consequences of COVID-19. These multi-systemic consequences, which are frequently observed in people with Long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, need rehabilitation to enhance general function, strength, and mobility.</p><p>Persistent Fatigue and Post-Exertional Fatigue, Deconditioning and Weakness of Muscles, Breathing Issues and Reduced Lung Capability, Pain and stiffness in the joints, Symptoms related to the nervous system (neuropathy, paresthesia, brain fog), Syndrome of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia (POTS), Heart Deconditioning, Problems with Mental Health (Depression and Anxiety), Sleep Disorders, Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing and speaking, Persistent Pain (Symptoms of Fibromyalgia or Myalgia).</p><h3>What role does physiotherapy play in preventing complications like ICU-acquired weakness and post-intensive care syndrome in COVID-19 patients?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><div><ul><li><p>Preventing ICU-AW (ICU-Acquired Weakness) Because of immobility, inflammation, and the effects of mechanical ventilation, ICU-AW patients have severe muscular wasting and weakness. For that Early Mobilization, Bed exercises. helping patients regain strength and tolerance to upright posture&amp; Early walking with assistance as soon as the patient is stable. Electrical stimulation of muscles to promote muscle contraction and minimize atrophy, especially in patients unable to exercise.</p><p>Diaphragmatic and inspiratory muscle strengthening exercises to prevent or reduce respiratory muscle weakness caused by prolonged ventilation. Exercises that mimic daily activities (e.g., transferring from bed to chair) to promote independence and functional strength are also done.</p></li><li><p>Handling the Syndrome of Post-Intensive Care (PICS) A variety of cognitive, psychological, and physical deficits that appear after ICU release are included in PICS strength and aerobic training regimens to restore endurance, increase mobility, and stop further deconditioning; Balance and coordination training: exercises to increase stability and lower the risk of falls, which are common in PICS patients; Stretching, soft tissue mobilization, and gentle exercise to reduce joint pain and muscle stiffness from prolonged immobility; Breathing and Pulmonary Rehabilitation Training to improve lung function and reduce dyspnea (shortness of breath).</p><p>To lessen pressure on bony regions and avoid ulcers, we help patients to change positions.To avoid immobility-induced contractures (permanent shortening of muscles or joints), splints or braces are used in conjunction with gentle stretching.</p></li></ul></div><h3>How important was a multidisciplinary approach (involving doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals) in managing COVID-19 rehabilitation?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><p>Team members work together to develop customized care plans, guaranteeing that patients receive complementary therapies without conflict or duplication. Enhanced Recuperation. Integrated treatment helps patients regain functional independence more quickly by more effectively addressing the underlying causes of symptoms. In order to improve adherence to care plans and raise overall satisfaction, the patient&#39;s goals, needs, and preferences are prioritized.</p><h3>What are your key takeaways from working with COVID-19 patients, and how has this experience shaped your approach to physiotherapy?</h3><hr class='mt-0' /><div><p>In addition to physical problems, COVID-19 made it clear that mental health, emotional stability, and social elements that impact recovery must also be addressed.</p><p>Respiratory exercises, functional training, and early mobilization are essential for reducing post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and ICU-acquired weakness.</p><p>Due to COVID-19 limits, efficient care delivery required adaptability, inventiveness, and cutting-edge techniques like tele-rehabilitation.</p><p>For COVID-19 patients, close collaboration with physicians, nurses, mental health specialists, and respiratory therapists led to better results.</p><p>During the pandemic, tele-rehabilitation became an essential service that worked well for a lot of patients.</p><p>Patients experienced loneliness, fear, and uncertainty, thus empathy and open communication were crucial so by this it enhanced ability to communicate clearly in order to simplify complicated rehabilitation plans. a more patient-centered, sympathetic strategy that recognizes the emotional difficulties that patients could be going through.</p></div>"
